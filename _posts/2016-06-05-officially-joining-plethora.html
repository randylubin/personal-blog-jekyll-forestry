<p>I’m excited to announce that I’m joining <a href="https://www.plethora.com/" target="_blank">Plethora</a> - a next-gen manufacturing startup! I’ve been following the company since before my friend Nick founded it and it’s great to finally be a part of the team.</p><h2>About Plethora</h2><p>Plethora is striving to empower engineers and designers by making hardware manufacturing insanely easy. Our initial focus is on reducing time to go from designing a part to getting it in your hand.</p><p>We have a plug-in for CAD (design) software that gives users instant feedback on price and manufacturability; then, a user can order their part from within the software and we’ll make it in just a couple days. This is a dramatic improvement over the alternative: spending hours discussing terms with local machine shops and then waiting a week or two to get your part. <a href="https://www.plethora.com/" target="_blank">Try us out</a> and you’ll get $250 of free machining (probably enough for your first part).</p><p>I can’t go into specifics about the long-term vision, but it’s about supercharging the hardware design process and reducing the barriers to creation. I’ve always been scared away from founding a hardware startup because it much more complex and risky than starting software / web companies. As Plethora succeeds, we’ll be making hardware as easy as software.</p><h2>My Role</h2><p>My role is Business Operations and Strategy - an intentionally nebulous description that will morph with the needs of the company.</p><p>I’ve been consulting with Plethora since February and my initial focus is marketing, sales, and business development, building the engines that will drive our user adoption and growth.</p><p>I’m very excited about the future of Plethora. My criteria for joining any company is always:</p><ul><li>Do they have a great vision?<br/></li><li>Is there a realistic roadmap for reaching that vision?<br/></li><li>Do they have the right team and culture to pull it off?<br/></li><li>Is there interesting work that I can help with?<br/></li></ul><p>Plethora answers all of those questions with a resounding yes. I’m looking forward to working with an awesome team on very interesting problems to dramatically reshape how hardware is designed and manufactured.</p>
