<p>Just a quick post tonight, as it&rsquo;s already pretty late.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been building the game I mentioned in <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-02-03-game-idea-inspired-by-the-origins-of-political.html-order" target="_blank">this post</a>. The working title is Nation Builder but I&rsquo;ll likely change it soon.</p>

<p>I spent a good chunk of this weekend working on it and the process has been a lot of fun. I love the flow state associated with coding and that it&rsquo;s for a game just amps up the fun.</p>

<p>I usually try to isolate just one new concept per project I take on but I&rsquo;m biting off a bit more this time. The two big new things are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element" target="_blank">HTML5&rsquo;s Canvas</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>. Canvas lets you draw objects in HTML and is fairly easy to learn. Backbone.js is a Model-View-Presenter framework that is client-side and is useful for making complex, single-page web apps; the learning curve is much steeper but it&rsquo;s very powerful and I&rsquo;m getting the hang of it.</p>

<p>The big vision for the game is incredibly complex and I&rsquo;m hoping to quickly churn out rough prototypes that feature just a small subset of the game but are playable on their own. I was torn about whether to start with a map based game or have it all a statistical model. While just numbers would be easier, I decided to go with the map as I&rsquo;ll have more fun interacting with it and I&rsquo;ll need to keep my motivation high to see it through.</p>

<p>When thinking through some of the models, I&rsquo;ve gone on some really fun tangents. The game needs to simulate population growth and my initial thought was to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map" target="_blank">logistic map</a>. Logistic maps are the simplest equations that can behave chaotically; I first encountered them when reading up on Chaos Theory and am having fun with them in the game. From there I learned about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equation" target="_blank">Lotka-Volterra Equation</a>, which models the population of predator and prey over time. It&rsquo;s very cool and I&rsquo;ll be building into the game soon. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about that equation, check out <a href="http://vimeo.com/23839605" target="_blank">this video</a> by the consistently inspiring Bret Victor.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for this post. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get another chunk of the game done soon and have something interactive to share!</p>
