<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get my brother into coding for years now. He&rsquo;s expressed interest but has always been too busy. Last week, having just finished his first semester at college - and bored at home on winter break - was finally ready to learn.</p>

<p>I was in San Francisco and he was in NJ so we started over video chat. I outlined the various parts of web development, described how they fit together, and then let him pick where to start. He opted to begin with front-end coding as he liked the quick feedback loop and wanted to create a personal website. He found back-end programming interesting but didn&rsquo;t have any project ideas about which he was excited.</p>

<p>Normally we&rsquo;d sit at the same computer and I&rsquo;d walk him through different examples but being on opposite coasts complicated things. I turned to the excellent <a href="http://scratchpad.io" target="_blank">Scratchpad.io</a> - a tool which allows for real-time collaborative editing and instant rendering; it was just what we needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/11a891cf65654e47c5db3bfa5ada76c0/tumblr_inline_mgllcoonzq1qc3e3u.png" alt="Scratchpad.io"/></p>

<p>I outlined various concepts in HTML and CSS with real-time examples and then tasked him with changing the examples. Being able to see the impact of his changes in real-time was valuable for both of us and I loved being able to help him as he typed.</p>

<p>After walking him through HTML and CSS, I wanted to give him a taste of JavaScript. Scratchpad.io doesn&rsquo;t allow JS yet so I decided to use <a href="http://c9.io" target="_blank">Cloud9</a>. Cloud9 is a web based IDE (interactive development environment) and was a bit overkill for what we needed. It did however allow for JS and use of multiple files.</p>

<p>With a taste of JS under his belt, I set him free to build his website. I sent him some links to Mozilla&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/" target="_blank">documentation</a> and told him to ping me if he gets stuck. He&rsquo;s since been building up the site and asking lots of good questions. I warned him in advance that front-end code is kludgey because it was designed by committee over a couple decades; he was perplexed by why CSS Floats are such a pain.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s refining the first version now and I&rsquo;m starting to look ahead to what to teach next. I&rsquo;m eager to show him Bootstrap - I&rsquo;ve held off so that he could learn the fundamentals himself. I&rsquo;d also like to introduce him to jQuery. Other things on the horizon are MVC web apps, how to use the terminal / Linux, and how to deal with data / databases. I&rsquo;ll also send him to check out Codecademy in advance of our impending dual on <a href="http://fightcodegame.com/" target="_blank">FightCode</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a fun journey!</p>
