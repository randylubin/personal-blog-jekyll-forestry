<p><em>Update: I&rsquo;ve launched the game at <a href="http://plotypus.com/" target="_blank">Plotypus.com</a> and am <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11JkmwRjOYLij3mYyOxODymbVG3jB3fj5bhIpfKU5QB8/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank">taking orders</a> for a limited time.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m extremely excited to share Plotypus - a game I&rsquo;ve been developing for the past few months. I just received the first test print from the printer and the cards look great!</p>

<p>Plotypus is a collaborative storytelling card game. The goal is to enable a group of friends to tell an epic story with a gripping plot. While there are already some excellent storytelling games (Microscope, Fiasco, Once Upon A Time), they tend to yield messy plots - though they are tremendously fun. My goal with Plotypus is to have a fun game that generates a great story.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had plenty of help developing this game; my main collaborator has asked to remain anonymous but he&rsquo;s been instrumental in the evolution of the rules and design of the cards. Thanks also go to all the friends who have helped me playtest.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be posting the files and manual online, after I make one last round of revisions.</p>

<h3>Game Overview</h3>

<p>The game has two parts: Setup and Storytelling. During the setup phase, the players choose settings cards and hero / villain archetypes. These form the context of the story.</p>

<p>In the storytelling phase, each player describes a few sentences of the plot, advancing the story. The players follow the Storybook cards which define the key chapters and guide the overarching narrative.</p>

<p>Once per act, players draw a catalyst card which raises the stakes.</p>

<p>If the players are stuck, they can draw random character and settings cards for inspiration. There is also a deck of narrative devices to mix things up.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Now that I have a test print, I need to make a round of design edits. I&rsquo;m pleased with how they look so there won&rsquo;t be too much work. I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://www.printplaygames.com/" target="_blank">PrintPlayGames</a> and they&rsquo;ve been easy and high quality.</p>

<p>After tweaking the designs, I&rsquo;ll post the files online so anyone can print their own copy. I&rsquo;ll continue to conduct playtests and take feedback to refine the game.</p>

<p>Assuming I get a positive response, I hope to run a Kickstarter for this sometime next year.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s lots of interest, there is plenty of room for expansion packs, including cards from myriad genres and settings.</p>
