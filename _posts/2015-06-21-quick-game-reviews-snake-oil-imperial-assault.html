<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I reviewed board games here so I&rsquo;ll provide three quick ones of games I&rsquo;ve played lately.</p>

<h3>Snake Oil</h3>

<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/113289/snake-oil" target="_blank">Snake Oil</a> is a fast and fun party game in the vein of Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. Unlike those two games, Snake Oil involves a bit more skill and creativity.</p>

<p>Each player draws a hand of six item cards (e.g. hammer, jetpack, lunchbox) and then one player draws a customer card (e.g. caveman, teacher, astronaut). Each other player then has 30 seconds to make a sales pitch to the &lsquo;customer&rsquo; based on two items from that players hand. For example, a player might try to convince the 'caveman&rsquo; that they are in desperate need of a jetpack-hammer (maybe for better hunting mammoths). After each player makes a pitch, the player with the customer card decides which was best. The next player then becomes customer and another round begins.</p>

<p>I like this much better than Apples to Apples or Cards Agains Humanity because there&rsquo;s more skill involved. The pitches are a great exercise in constrained creativity and improv. The rounds are fast and fun and the game is a perfect filler while waiting for other friends to show up or to kick off a day of gaming.</p>

<h3>Imperial Assault</h3>

<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164153/star-wars-imperial-assault" target="_blank">Imperial Assault</a> is the spiritual successor to <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104162/descent-journeys-dark-second-edition" target="_blank">Descent: Journeys in the Dark</a> and it&rsquo;s set in the Star Wars universe.</p>

<p>The rules are very similar to Descent but a little more streamlined, especially around line-of-sight and movement. It has a similarly massive campaign but includes a new Skirmish that pits two players against each other.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m two missions into a campaign with my brother and a friend and I&rsquo;m greatly enjoying it so far. Skirmish mode seems to work well, though I&rsquo;ve only done one mission. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how the game evolves over the course of a campaign.</p>

<h3>Welcome to the Dungeon</h3>

<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/150312/welcome-dungeon" target="_blank">Welcome to the Dungeon</a> is a cool new game from Japan. I grabbed it after seeing a stellar review on <a href="http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/" target="_blank">Shut Up and Sit Down</a>. It&rsquo;s a very quick game that involves a little bluffing, deduction, and gambling.</p>

<p>Players take turns sending a hero through a dungeon. Each round, player build up a dungeon full of monsters - each turn they secretly add a monster or discard a monster but if they discard a monster then they need to make the hero weaker; they can also pass and remove themsleves from the round. As the round progresses, the dungeon gets harder and the hero gets weaker - the goal is to either intimidate other players into passing or to pass once the dungeon is too hard to beat. The final player who hasn&rsquo;t passed has to fight all the monsters and possibly die. First to beat the dungeon twice wins but if you die twice, you&rsquo;re gone.</p>

<p>The game is fast and fun and will likely be getting serious rotation this summer.</p>
