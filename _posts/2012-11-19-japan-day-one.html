<p>Arrived today (Monday) in Tokyo and so far I love the city. It feels like a denser, cleaner version of London: a sprawling, energetic city with myriad diverse neighborhoods and plenty of big parks.</p>



<p>Our flight got in late afternoon and we spent most of the evening walking around Akihabara (electronics district) and the park in Ueno. Then, we grabbed some delicious soba noodles and Japanese curry (ordering at random off a menu we couldn&rsquo;t read).</p>



<p>Tomorrow is going to be a busy day: fish market in the morning and hanging out with the tech scene in the afternoon. I&rsquo;ll aim for small, daily blog posts each week but we&rsquo;ll see&hellip;</p>
