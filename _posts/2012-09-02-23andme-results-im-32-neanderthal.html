<p>A few weeks ago I signed up for a personal genome sequencing through 23andMe (<a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-08-12-just-signed-up-for-23andme.html" target="_blank">post</a>). I received the first round of results this weekend.</p>
<p>The results are broken into two broad categories: Health and Ancestry.</p>
<h3>Health</h3>
<p>Health is broken into four subcategories:</p>
<ul><li>Disease Risk</li>
<li>Carrier Status</li>
<li>Drug Response</li>
<li>Traits</li>
</ul><p>I was most interested in disease risk as it indicates what future maladies I may face. Luckily there wasn&rsquo;t any bad news lurking in my genes. A few risks were a little higher than average but nothing too bad. For example: I have a slightly higher risk of deep vein thrombosis so I&rsquo;ll take extra care to move my feet when I&rsquo;m flying.</p>
<div></div>
<p>On the plus side, I have a much lower than average chance of developing Alzheimers, Celiac or Diabetes (type one or two). I&rsquo;m also not a carrier for any of the typical recessive hereditary diseases found among Ashkenazi Jews, though I am a carrier for the much rarer Familial Mediterranean Fever gene; good to know!</p>
<div></div>
<p>Nothing too surprising on the drug response or traits sections; much of it I already knew (e.g. slow caffeine metabolism - a cup in the late afternoon and I&rsquo;ll have trouble sleeping).</p>
<div></div>
<p>As I read through the traits results I had an interesting meta-insight: I was suffering from heavy confirmation bias. When I saw certain things that fit well in my world view (e.g. I&rsquo;m likely to be a sprinter) I thought &lsquo;of course&rsquo; but when I saw the opposite I would shrug it off; just something to be aware of as I engage with data in the future.</p>
<h3>Ancestry</h3>
<p>Ancestry is still processing but I&rsquo;ll share those results when they arrive. The only info there so far is that 3.2% of my DNA is from Neanderthals (compared to a population average of 2.5%). Perhaps that is why I find this Yahoo Answers clip so amusing?</p>

<p>Anyway&hellip; the first bit of results have been fun and I&rsquo;m excited to see the ancestry portion of 23andMe. I&rsquo;ll post here when I find out.</p>
