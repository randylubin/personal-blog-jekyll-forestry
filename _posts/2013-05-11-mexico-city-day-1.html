<p>I&rsquo;m taking a short trip to Mexico City and aim to do daily blog posts; I really enjoyed blogging my Japan trip last fall.</p>

<p>This trip is a last minute with my roommate Adam and his friend Sara. We have almost no plans and are making it up on the fly.</p>

<p>After arriving at 6am on the red eye from SF and immediately fell asleep for a few hours at the hotel. Once awake we walked down to Chapultepec, a large park in central Mexico City. The park is full of museums and we spent many hours at the Museum of Anthropology; the museum has fantastic exhibits on the indigenous civilizations that have inhabited Mexico.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a shot of a reconstructed Mayan temple:<img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc77e6b9bff24a9afd458a8dda5f1f92/tumblr_inline_mmnxgqSlB11qz4rgp.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>From the museum we walked through the nearby Botanical Gardens and then around the Zona Rosa neighborhood. We then went to a local bar and watched the America vs Pumas playoff game (Liga MX professional soccer) - it was a great game and America won, advancing to the semi-finals.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re hanging at the hotel now and gathering the energy to go to an Argentinian Steakhouse.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we&rsquo;re planning to explore the city some more but I&rsquo;m especially excited for Monday when we go to Teotihuacan - temple ruins.</p>
