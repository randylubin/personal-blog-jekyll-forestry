<p>Just wrapping up my first day in Delhi. The flight in was smooth but long. Internet has been tough to come by so far but should be set by the time I return from Nepal.</p>

<p>The IIIT Delhi campus - where I&rsquo;ll be based - is nice and we have a great space carved out for the Innovate Delhi program.</p>

<p>Today we drove around getting ready. Traffic was a bit rough but I&rsquo;m starting to get a sense of the city.</p>

<p>The weather has been rough - very, very hot with toasty wind known as the Loo. We&rsquo;ll see if I get used to it!</p>

<p>Next update from will be from Nepal - I head out tomorrow&hellip;</p>
