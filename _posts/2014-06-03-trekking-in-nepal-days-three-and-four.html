<h3>Trekking Day Three: Ghorepani to Ghandruk</h3>

<p>We awoke in Ghorepani at 4:30am to trek up Poon Hill. The views at sunrise are supposed to be spectacular but we&rsquo;d heard that the past few mornings had been cloudy.</p>

<p>As we climbed, we discovered our luck - there were just a few high clouds and they only added to the epic views.</p>

<p>So yeah - well worth the early wake-up. Many of the peaks in the picture are over 7000m (~23k feet). We stayed up there for maybe an hour and probably could have hung around all day - but the trail was calling.</p>

<p>We ate a hardy breakfast and then said goodbye to Ghorepani.</p>

<p>Immediately out of the village we faced a steep climb which led to more great views.</p>

<p>We then began to descend, following a riverbed. Our goal for the day was Ghandruk - a large village at about 2000m elevation. To get there we needed to cover a lot of ground and lose a lot of altitude; there were also several small villages to pass through.</p>

<p>It was our longest day of hiking so far but we got there by 3:30pm - throughly exhausted.</p>

<h3>Trekking Day Four: Ghandruk to Nayapul</h3>

<p>When we went to sleep, the himalayan peaks were shrouded in clouds. We awoke to stunning views.</p>

<p>The views held as we began our descent to Nayapul, completing our loop. Every bend in the trail, we&rsquo;d look back and take in the mountains.</p>

<p>After a few hours of steep downhill, we grabbed a taxi in Nayapul and arrived back in Pokhara in time for lunch.</p>

<p>It was an amazing four days on the trail and I&rsquo;d highly recommend it to anyone interested. Our pace was aggressive (our four day loop usually takes 5-6 days) but we were never too sore or tired.</p>

<p>We decided not to hire any guides / porters and we didn&rsquo;t feel we needed them. It might make sense, though, if you&rsquo;re going to higher altitudes or there during the busy season (so they can run ahead and secure housing). We were definitely traveling off-peak season and I really enjoyed the quiet on the trails. Hours would pass without seeing other trekkers. We&rsquo;ve heard in the busy months the trails and villages are packed with tourists.</p>

<p>With the trek complete, we spent the day relaxing in Pokhara. We also made arrangements for a ride to Kathmandu, with rafting along the way. I&rsquo;ll cover that in the next post. Here is one last photo of the mountains at sunrise:</p>
