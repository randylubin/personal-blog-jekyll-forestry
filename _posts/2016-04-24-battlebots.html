<p>This week, Avital and I got to check out the filming of Batttlebots, the robot fighting competition. One of my colleagues is a competitor and he was kind enough to get us passes - thanks Christopher!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/e0d49352e6f9ac27a39c353a0c856789/tumblr_inline_o66bzjDx1x1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>After a many year hiatus, the show returned last year. We watched the filming for the first round of finals for the new season. Because it won’t air for a while, I couldn’t take pictures of the bots and I can’t talk about specific fights.</p><p>We got to watch a few bot fights and they were very cool. The machines had a 250 pound weight limit. Some had spinning blades, others had flying drones, and one had a powerful pneumatic flipping arm. A match lasts three minutes and the bots are trying to destroy each other. If both are working at the end of the match, judges pick a winner.</p><p>The fights were a blast to watch and it was especially cool knowing how much time and effort the teams had put into building their bots.</p><p>Filming just ended for this season but check them out next year if you have a chance!</p>
