<p>I was recently chatting with some friends about work / life balance and also having work aligned with one&rsquo;s values. I ended up drawing a pyramid on the whiteboard that felt a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" target="_blank">Maslow&rsquo;s Heirarchy of Needs</a>. Here were the levels:</p>

<ul><li>Working all the time to survive</li>
<li>Work / life balance - time for a life but no meaning from work</li>
<li>Work / life integration - work is aligned with ones values / one enjoys work</li>
<li>Work / life / world integration - you&rsquo;re able to leverge your time spent working to impact the world in a big way, aligned with your values</li>
</ul><p>We noted that we were extremely fortunate be toward the good end of the hierarchy but that many people were trapped in the first two stages. Many people I know are at least trying to hit that highest stage - which probably lines up with Maslow&rsquo;s self-actualization. Hopefully as automation creates more abundance, we&rsquo;ll be able to use something like basic income to empower more people to spend more of their time on things that change the world in ways aligned with their values.</p>
