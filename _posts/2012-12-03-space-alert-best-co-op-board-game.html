<p>Roommate <a href="http://chrismaury.com/" target="_blank">Chris Maury</a> recently grabbed the board game <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert" target="_blank">Space Alert</a> for his birthday and it just might be the most fun board game I&rsquo;ve ever played.</p>



<p>The general concept is that the players on crew on a space mission and need to survive for 10 minutes. The style is cooperative - everyone works together and you win or lose as a group.</p>



<p>The 10 minutes are played out in real time and there is an MP3 describing everything that goes wrong: alien attacks, malfunctions, intruders, etc. The players than have to run around the ship and take action by playing cards from their hands.</p>



<p>After the ten minutes you look back over what each player did and then you get to find out whether you survived or not. There&rsquo;ve been a few times that we thought we won but later found out that a damage prevented us from firing a crucial laser shot.</p>



<p>The ten minute real time phase is chaotic and demands high coordination and communication among the players; it&rsquo;s challenging and a lot of fun. The recap after is a little tedious by hand but luckily there&rsquo;s a great Flash application which resolves it all for you; there are even funny animations of your players running around.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve now played it with 2, 3, and 5 players and on multiple difficulties; I&rsquo;m confident in saying it&rsquo;s the best game I&rsquo;ve played and perfect for any size group.</p>
