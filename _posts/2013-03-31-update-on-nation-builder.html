<p>After a several week break, I finally returned to coding Nation Builder. I only logged a few hours this weekend but I&rsquo;m hoping to pick up the pace and maybe post an hour or two per night.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to put the current pre-alpha online. Disclaimer: it&rsquo;s not really a game yet - there&rsquo;s no winning, there&rsquo;s no balance, and it&rsquo;s missing some key elements in the game loop. I just though it&rsquo;d be nice to post what I&rsquo;ve written so far.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/88691a09101d46b20acc154c42e3cf72/tumblr_inline_mkkatbVWQC1qz4rgp.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The pre-alpha of <a href="http://nationbuilding.randylubin.com/" target="_blank">Nation Building</a></p>

<p>The code at <a href="https://github.com/randylubin/Nation-Building/tree/master/Band%20Expansion" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>

<h3>The current state of the game</h3>

<p>A new map generates each refresh with random water and placement of bands.</p>

<p>You control a band of hunter-gathers and can order them (by clicking on a hex) to stay put or to explore adjacent territories. If you stay in the same place too long, you exhaust the local ecology and your population starts to crash.</p>

<p>There are AI controlled bands - they move to whatever neighboring hex has the greatest ecology.</p>

<h3>Next up</h3>

<p>First order of business is balancing the growth / decay dynamics. For testing, I&rsquo;ve built a very crude model but it&rsquo;s probably time to use the dynamical systems / chaos stuff I was playing with at the beginning.</p>

<p>I also need to put in the logic of what happens when two bands meet. I&rsquo;m planning to give the player options: trade, fight, flee, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to add the win conditions. This will likely involve discovering certain tech that allows the band to become an agrarian tribe.</p>
