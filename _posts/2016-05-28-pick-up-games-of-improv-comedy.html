<p>I’ve always been interested in taking an improv comedy class but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. Given my love of storytelling and games, I image I’ll thoroughly enjoy ad libbing with a team.</p><p>My understanding is that if you want to participate in improv, you can take a class or join a troupe but there isn’t a casual way of participating. Even the ‘amateur’ improv groups seem to demand massive time commitments. This partly makes sense, as a troupe needs to know each other extremely well to put on a smooth show.</p><p>If you’re into sports, there are plenty of lightweight ways to get playing. There are amateur leagues where you don’t need to be at every game. Better yet, there are pick-up games where you can just show up and join a team. I haven’t heard of any similar thing for improv.</p><p>I’m thinking about starting a reoccurring pick-up event for improv comedy. Anyone, of any skill, could drop in and participate in scenes. The only audience would be other players so it’d be a safe, encouraging environment. We’d probably have a big roster of different improv ‘games’ to play and we’d likely do a debrief after each one (to discuss how to improve).</p><p>Does something like this exist? Is there a big flaw I’m missing? Interested in joining? Let me know!</p>
