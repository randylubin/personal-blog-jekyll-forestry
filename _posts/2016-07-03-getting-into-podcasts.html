<p>Since starting at Plethora, I’ve been spending more time in the car, commuting. I’ve been reclaiming this time through podcasts and I’m totally hooked on a number of them.</p><p>Many of them are game related so I wrote up a list of <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/learn/podcasts" target="_blank">Game and Game Design Podcasts</a> on my site <a href="http://diegeticgames.com" target="_blank">Diegetic Games</a>. Here are some of my favorite non-game podcasts:</p><p><a href="http://reviewthefuture.com" target="_blank">Review the Future</a>: fun futurist podcast looking at the impact of technology on society in the present and future</p><p><a href="http://exponent.fm/" target="_blank">Epicenter</a>: awesome strategic analysis of the tech industry</p><p><a href="https://www.mythpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Myths and Legends</a>: entertaining retellings of classic stories with lots of good context</p><p><a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/" target="_blank">Writing Excuses</a>: top authors sharing tips on their craft</p><p><a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/" target="_blank">99% Invisible</a>: Great storytelling about hidden aspects of our society</p><h2>Listening with Overcast</h2><p>I use <a href="http://overcast.fm" target="_blank">Overcast</a> to listen to the podcasts. It’s a great app that gives me plenty of control over show subscriptions and downloads. It also has a great playlist capability so I can organize my shows my category. My favorite features are the speed-up effects - I listen at ~2.5x speed with the silences shortened and devour episodes in short order.</p><p>Have I missed any of your favorite shows? Let me know in the comments!</p>
