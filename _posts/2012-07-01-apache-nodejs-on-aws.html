<p>A quick technical post this week. I&rsquo;ve done away with Apache on my AWS server and am now using Node.js for all my web server needs.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly creating little web apps, for fun and to learn new concepts. I want to run them simultaneously and as separate apps. I&rsquo;ve toyed around with <a href="http://nodester.com/" target="_blank">Nodester</a> and <a href="https://nodejitsu.com/" target="_blank">Nodejitsu</a> (Heroku for Node.js) but wanted root access to the server. When I first started with Node.js I was using Apache on my <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank">free AWS</a> server and setting up a new virtual host for each app. It worked alright but was a pain to quickly add new apps.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>I wrote a Node.js Server to listen in on port 80 and then proxy my apps running on various other ports. I started fresh on a new EC2 instance and didn&rsquo;t bother to install Apache.</p>
<p>The server was just a few lines of code and now I can add new apps with one line of code and restarting the Node.js app; much easier than what I was doing with Apache.</p>
<p>You can check out the server code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/3029265" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
<p>I highly recommend trying this out if you&rsquo;re in a similar situation; feel free to reach out if you have any questions.</p>
