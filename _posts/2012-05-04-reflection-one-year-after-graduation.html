<p>This weekend is the Stanford GSB one year reunion. I figure now&rsquo;s a good time reflect on the time since graduation.</p>
<h2>Founder Ambitions</h2>
<p>When I graduated last June, I aimed to start my own company.  I hadn&rsquo;t settled on an idea but knew I loved entrepreneurship.  My intention was to spend three to six months iterating on ideas, trying to find one I liked enough to build a team and raise funding.</p>
<p>My method was usually something like this:</p>
<ol><li>Find an awesome thesis (usually based on a new technology or social pattern)</li>
<li>Generate product/service ideas based on that thesis</li>
<li>Validate/kill the idea by speaking with potential customers / experts / investors</li>
<li>Do I fall out of love with the idea?</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol><div>I churned through a lot of different ideas and had a great time along the way.  Ultimately, none of the ideas stuck.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&rsquo;m a big believer in the importance of entrepreneur authenticity. Right now there isn&rsquo;t a problem/opportunity that I&rsquo;m extremely focused/passionate about conquering. I definitely don&rsquo;t want to start a company for its own sake.  Thus, I will wait until I discover an idea/problem that I&rsquo;m crazy about.</div>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to push my coding abilities and I&rsquo;m now confident I can quickly prototype any startup idea I have; that&rsquo;s a really powerful feeling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a bit on my growth <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-03-02-level-up-intermediate-programmer.html" target="_blank">here</a> so I won&rsquo;t say much else&hellip;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning yourself, I wrote this for Digital Trends: <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/coding-for-the-rest-of-us-why-you-should-learn-and-how-to-get-started/" target="_blank">Coding for the Rest of Us</a></p>
<p>Here are a few things I&rsquo;ve built:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://karma.randylubin.com" target="_blank">Karma!</a> - Karma visualizer for Reddit</li>
<li><a href="http://randylubin.com/ecosystem/" target="_blank">Ecosystem</a> - Dynamic, interactive art</li>
<li><a href="http://randylubin.com" target="_blank">Personal Homepage</a> - Always iterating on this</li>
<li><a href="http://ditchtheconference.com" target="_blank">Ditch the Conference</a> - Fake site for Hype Up Weekend</li>
<li><a href="http://stealthisidea.randylubin.com/" target="_blank">Steal This Idea</a> - My excuse to learn NodeJS/MongoDB</li>
</ul><h2>Consulting</h2>
<p>As I was churning through my own startup ideas, I began taking on consulting gigs with other startups. This proved to be great for a few reasons.</p>
<ul><li>I love working with other entrepreneurs</li>
<li>A wide array of challenges kept me intellectually stimulated and I got to use a variety of MBA skills</li>
<li>The income helped me extend my runway</li>
</ul><div>My consulting now ranges from business/product strategy to product management to coding (front end and back end) and I still still love it.</div>
<h2>Blogging</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been blogging regularly since January and enjoying it. It helps me articulate my thoughts and improve as a writer. I highly recommend starting.</p>
<p>Part of my motivation is <a href="http://iron-blogger-sf.com/" target="_blank">Iron Blogger</a>, a group of SF bloggers who commit to writing one post per week; if we don&rsquo;t post, we put $5 in the pot.  Once there&rsquo;s enough money we go drinking.  So far I haven&rsquo;t missed a week!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also written for Digital Trends - a large, professional tech blog.  I enjoyed that experience and hope to write for them again.</p>
<h2>Living in San Francisco</h2>
<p>I moved up to SF in August and love it up here.  I&rsquo;m living in the Mission neighborhood, which is teeming with entrepreneurs / startups.  I&rsquo;ve met a ton of awesome people and had a lot of fun. Living up here exposes me to a lot more serendipity than down in South Bay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very glad I moved up to the city and will likely be here for a while!</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s Next</h2>
<p>While I still want to start my own company, I&rsquo;m keeping the bar very high. I hope to find an idea I love but I&rsquo;m not counting on it happening soon.</p>
<p>I can continue my consulting indefinitely but am open to joining a company full time.  Again, I&rsquo;m keeping the bar really high; I need an amazing team with an incredible vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an awesome year since graduation and I&rsquo;m excited to see what the next year brings.</p>
