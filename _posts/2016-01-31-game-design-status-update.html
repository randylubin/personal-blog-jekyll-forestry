<p>Just a quick update on some games I have in the works.</p><p>I’m pretty happy with where my collaborative worldbuilding game <b>Panorama</b> is and I’ll be moving the rules from a Google Doc into something with more panache. If you’re interested in the current rules, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/196biB_Vu8OoiipHMYvR_FdoqLCE-pJ3wdRP1B_qbyNk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">check them out here</a> - I’d love feedback!</p><p>I mentioned my speedy collaborative conspiracy theory game <b>It’s All Connected!</b> last week and I’ve written up the rules. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHhw1rj9EGahplaErI5liNGsKAAfqVnuCeMgrVDwwPw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Check them out here</a> and let me know if you play it!</p><p>I have two other game in the works which I hope to share more on soon. There’s a lightweight, diceless RPG where players are mages and they have cards that represent abilities, spells, and assets. I’m developing it with a good friend and we got great feedback on our first playtest - we’re hoping to do a few more playtests this month.</p><p>The other game is a hack of the great lightweight RPG <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf" target="_blank">Lasers and Feelings</a>. Mine will be set in near-future San Francisco and called <b>Hackers and Hustlers</b>. I have a lot of the modifications sketched out and I hope to post more about it soon!</p>
