<p>2011 was an awesome year for me, full of change.</p>
<p>I spent the first half of the year wrapping up my MBA program at Stanford.  The final quarter was bittersweet-tons of fun classes, events, and parties but we weren&rsquo;t ready for it to end; the two years had gone by incredibly quickly.  Graduation weeks was excellent and I loved having my parents and grandparents in town.</p>
<p>Once school ended, I decided to give myself 3 to 6 months to settle on a start-up idea to build.  I&rsquo;ve been churning through concepts since coming to Stanford (earlier, really) and have been ruthless in killing them.  I developed a few theses I liked but couldn&rsquo;t settle on an implementation&hellip; I&rsquo;ll try to write separate posts about the different areas of focus.</p>
<p>Alongside the start-up brainstorming, I&rsquo;ve been consulting for different start-ups. I&rsquo;ve had a blast jumping in with different companies and helping out where I can.  The teams I&rsquo;ve worked with are amazing and I&rsquo;ve learned a tremendous amount from them.  I&rsquo;ve also continued teaching myself to code; lately I&rsquo;ve been playing with Node.js but I&rsquo;ll defer that to another post.</p>
<p>After my on-campus housing ended I stayed with friends in Palo Alto for much of the summer; major thanks to Dani and Tris for letting me stay in their guest bedroom for a month!  As the summer continued I was torn about staying in Palo Alto or moving up to SF.  I chose SF.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been living in the Mission neighborhood since August and I love it here.  I&rsquo;m in an awesome apartment in a great location, with incredible roommates.  We have lots of geeky/tech conversations and everyone is involved in the start-up scene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an incredible year and I expect 2012 to be even better.  I&rsquo;ll write another post soon describing what I&rsquo;m up to these days and some goals for the coming months.</p>
