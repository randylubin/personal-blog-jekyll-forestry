<p>I&rsquo;m writing this from the comfort of my SF apartment - it was an amazing month in India but I&rsquo;m excited to be home!</p>

<h3>Innovate Delhi Finale</h3>

<p>After a successful start (<a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-06-10-innovate-delhi-week-one.html" target="_blank">Week 1</a>, <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-06-18-innovate-delhi-week-2.html" target="_blank">Week 2</a>), Innovate Delhi drew to a fun and exciting conclusion. The Student teams had plenty of excellent ideas and hustled to validate them by leaving campus to interview potential customers.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the week, Sharique and I coached the teams on pitching their ideas, aided by awesome designer <a href="https://twitter.com/grprtbedi" target="_blank">Gurpreet Bedi</a>. It was a grueling process but the teams improved rapidly.</p>

<p>Sunday morning was the final day of the program and culminated in the top five teams pitching a panel of judges (mostly VCs / founders). I spent the morning coaching the finalists on presenting and they all did a great job once they took the stage. iSPIRIT has a great writeup of the day: <a href="http://pn.ispirt.in/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish-innovatedelhi/" target="_blank">http://pn.ispirt.in/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish-innovatedelhi/</a></p>

<p>Innovate Delhi was a lot of fun but also exhausting. I had a blast meeting with and mentoring the students and seeing them grow. It will be exciting to see what they launch in the coming months and years.</p>

<h3>Final Days in Delhi</h3>

<p>With the program over, I had a few days to run around Delhi before heading home. The heat eased up from earlier highs of 115f but it was still over 100f on most day. The main sight-seeing I did was Humayun&rsquo;s Tomb - dating back to the 1500s. Here are some photos from it:</p>

<p>The tombs and grounds were in great shape - very cool to walk around and a good end to the month.</p>

<p>Overall, this was an awesome first taste of India. I&rsquo;m looking forward to returning someday soon and exploring more of the country!</p>
