<p>My last post <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-12-28-2014-recap.html" target="_blank">recapped 2014</a>, this post will look at some goals for 2015.</p>

<h3>Full-time Endeavors</h3>

<p>One short term goal is to find something to work on full-time. Ideally this would be my own startup but I&rsquo;m very leery of founding something for the sake of having a startup  - I&rsquo;ve seen too many founders fall into that trap. I&rsquo;ll keep brainstorming and validating ideas but I&rsquo;m not going to force it.</p>

<p>Barring my own startup, I&rsquo;m looking for awesome teams to join. Here is some of my criteria:</p>

<ul><li>Stage: early, potentially pre-product/market fit</li>
<li>Team: mostly technical - I love being the first business guy</li>
<li>Role:  COO / business generalist, with a hand in strategy, growth, and product</li>
<li>Sector: the future of work and decentralization of the economy</li>
</ul><p>If you know of an interesting opportunity - please send it my way!</p>

<h3>Projects / Productivity</h3>

<p>As I noted in my last post, I want to amp up my output this year. I tend to be most productive when I have a tight feedback loop - e.g. when I know I&rsquo;m going to share the results in the near future. To that end - feel free to hold me accountable by scheduling time to discuss or provide thoughts on what I&rsquo;m working on!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also very open to collaboration - my most productive periods last year all involved varying degrees of partnership. Things I aim to create this year include:</p>

<ul><li>More board / card games</li>
<li>Short stories</li>
<li>Little programming experiments / art</li>
<li>Long-form blog posts exploring trends in technology</li>
</ul>
