<p>The killer app for augmented reality glasses will likely be social intelligence.</p>
<h3>Google Glasses</h3>
<p>The New York Times recently <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/google-to-sell-terminator-style-glasses-by-years-end/?ref=technology" target="_blank">reported</a> that Google is developing augmented reality (AR) glasses.  The glasses will overlay various types of information onto the user&rsquo;s view.  It will be an Android device and thus (hopefully) be open to myriad third party apps.  The design is supposed to be similar to Oakley Thumps.</p>

<p>While AR Glasses are a very cool concept, it&rsquo;s not yet clear what will be the <em>Killer App</em>. Notifications (email, text, etc) and geographic information (e.g. turn-by-turn nav) will be nice, but I suspect they will provide marginal benefit over similar phone apps.</p>
<h3>Social Intelligence</h3>
<p>I think the most popular apps will be related to real-time social intelligence; the glasses will use facial recognition to overlay key information about the people around you.  Never forget a name again!  The glasses can remind you of a person&rsquo;s employer, children&rsquo;s names, and the last time you saw each other.  <a href="http://klik.me/" target="_blank">Klik</a> just launched on the iPhone and,in real time, displays a person&rsquo;s name over their head:</p>

<p>Another scenario involves highlighting people around you while walking down the street.  Different colors could represent:</p>
<ul><li>Close friends</li>
<li>Acquaintances</li>
<li>Celebrities</li>
<li>Convicted felons</li>
</ul><p>It probably won&rsquo;t look anything like Eagle Vision from Assassin&rsquo;s Creed but here&rsquo;s a screenshot anyway:</p>

<h3>Constant Sensors</h3>
<p>In addition to providing augmented reality, the glasses can also stream data to the cloud.  You will be able to use this data later for myriad interesting purposes of which I can only begin to speculate.  Snapshots of everyone you meet may be integrated into an online journal recording your interactions.  Google may offer a subsided pair of glasses if you allow them to track which stores you enter and which ads you look at.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all the musing I have for today but I plan on doing a follow-up post in the near future.</p>
