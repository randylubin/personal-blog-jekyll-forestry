<p>Today was my last day at Jive - I&rsquo;m heading back to the startup world!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been with Jive since we <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/post/35532405132/meetings-io-acquisition" target="_blank">sold Meetings.io</a> last year. I&rsquo;ve had a great time working with everyone there - first as PM of Real Time, then on the Corp Dev team - and I learned a lot about how big companies operate.</p>

<p>While the past year has been great - my heart is with early stage startups. I&rsquo;m going to take some time to explore my own startup ideas and hack on fun side projects. I&rsquo;ll also be keeping an eye out for awesome early-stage companies to join.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where the next few weeks will take me but I know it&rsquo;ll be fun!</p>
