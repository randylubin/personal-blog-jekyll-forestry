<p>This week I played <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123260/suburbia" target="_blank">Suburbia</a> - a very good board game about urban development.</p>

<p>You act as urban planner and lay hex tiles that represent residential, industrial, commercial, and civic regions. Each tiles has special attributes - for example, the heavy industry tile grants +1 cash but -1 reputation for each adjacent residential tile.</p>

<p>The goal is to grow your city as big as possible but you have to balance income and reputation. It&rsquo;s a tricky balance to maintain - grow to fast and you&rsquo;ll have income / reputation problems. There are only a few hexes you can purchase at any time but the choices are always interesting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing it on the iPad app, which has a great interface. In addition to the standard competitive mode (vs human or AI) there is a decent single player campaign (solitaire mode).</p>

<p>Overall - a great game, with the right mix of tactics and strategy. I highly recommend trying it out. You can also see a video review at the humorous and insightful review site Sit Down and Shut Up: <a href="http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/v/hexagonal-tile-laying-game-fest-2013/" target="_blank">http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/v/hexagonal-tile-laying-game-fest-2013/</a></p>
