<p>About this time last year I was working on a game called Nation Building. Inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_Political_Order" target="_blank">The Origins of Political Order</a>, the player would lead a civilization from humble origins as a band of hunter-gathers through tribe and city-state form to eventually form an empire. At least that was the vision. I documented my progress in blog posts here, but I eventually lost steam.</p>

<p>The first prototype was to involve moving you band of kinsmen across a map, growing until you could become a settled tribe; you can play the very unfinished version <a href="http://nationbuilding.randylubin.com/" target="_blank">here</a> - I spent more time working on the logic engine than honing the gameplay. Ultimately I struggled to balance interesting simulation of complex systems with fun gameplay.</p>

<p>This week, I&rsquo;ve revisited the concept. Instead of investing serious time in building the full game (or even just the band stage of the game) - I&rsquo;ve started by building out a few &lsquo;toys&rsquo; - micro-prototypes to test a simple mechanic to see if it is fun or interesting.</p>

<p>The first experiment involved a simple terminal based game around manipulating a band&rsquo;s birthrate. I have some basic systems in place to balance population with carrying capacity. I quickly scrapped the game together using Python and was able to explore several variations of non-linear systems. This didn&rsquo;t yield a fun game, but rapidly let me play with a potential game mechanic.</p>

<p>My next prototype has more of a focus on narrative. It starts off like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure but will quickly develop more game-like qualities. I&rsquo;m developing it with Angular and quickly built a branching decision engine. I&rsquo;m still in the process of rounding out the story but will post it here when I have a more complete prototype.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working on the Nation Building concept again and reinvigorated by the quick prototyping. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll make it a bit further than last year!</p>
