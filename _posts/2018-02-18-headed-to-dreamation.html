You can see full descriptions on the <a href="https://www.dexposure.com/d2018sched.html" target="_blank">schedule page</a>.</p><p>Thursday Night: Those Who Remain</p><p>Friday Morning: No Further Questions</p><p>Friday Afternoon: Jane</p><p>Friday Night: Event Horizon - Stowaways</p><p>Saturday Morning: Guest Suite</p><p>Saturday Afternoon: Public Memory</p><p>Saturday Night: Xenolanguage</p><p>Sunday Day: Behind the Magic</p><p>I just playtested Behind the Magic last night and it went really well! Just a few more tweaks before it’s finished&hellip;</p><p>It’s shaping up to be another great con and I’m looking forward to catching up with everyone!</p>
