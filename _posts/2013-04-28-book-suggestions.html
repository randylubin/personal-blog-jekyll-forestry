<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://www.voicedream.com/" target="_blank">Voice Dream</a> to listen to ebooks (credit to <a href="http://chrismaury.com" target="_blank">Chris Maury</a> for showing it to me). It&rsquo;s an awesome little app that allows you to load any epub, pdf, etc. and it will read it aloud. The voice is a little robotic sounding but I don&rsquo;t mind. The best feature is that you can accelerate the playback speed. Over the first week I had it, I started slow and then worked my way up to the to the max speed of 500 words per minute.</p>

<p>I actually don&rsquo;t mind reading on my phone but Voice Dream allows me to listen during my commute - when I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to read. I&rsquo;ve been tearing through a large back-log of reading.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been on a sci-fi binge - reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy" target="_blank">Mars Trilogy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schild%27s_Ladder" target="_blank">Schild&rsquo;s Ladder</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_Games" target="_blank">The Player of Games</a> - all excellent. Prior to that I read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Political_Order" target="_blank">The Origins of Political Order</a> - the book which inspired me to create the  Nation Building game.</p>

<p>The next book I&rsquo;ll read is probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile:_Things_That_Gain_from_Disorder" target="_blank">Antifragile</a> but I&rsquo;d love some suggestions for what to read next!</p>
