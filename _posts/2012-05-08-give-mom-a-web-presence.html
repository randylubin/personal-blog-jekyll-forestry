<p>Mother&rsquo;s Day is this Sunday - give Mom the gift of web presence.</p>
<p>For under $10 and less than an hour&rsquo;s work you can buy a domain and connect it to Tumblr (micro-blogging platform).  Featuring:</p>
<ul><li>Her own domain name (i.e. your-mom&rsquo;s-name.com)</li>
<li>A custom email address (i.e. mom&rsquo;s-name@mom&rsquo;s-name.com)</li>
<li>Easy blogging through Tumblr</li>
</ul><h2>Step 1: Buy a Domain</h2>
<p>I suggest buying the domain through Google - they automatically integrate it with Google Apps and Gmail.  It costs $10 per year and is hassle free.</p>
<p>Go <a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/standard/new3?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a> and click the &lsquo;Find Domain&rsquo; button (to the right) if you don&rsquo;t already own the domain. The rest of the check-out process is straight forward.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Create a Tumblr Account</h2>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> and sign up for a new account. You may want to use the new email address you created in Step 1.  The sign-up is pretty easy.</p>
<p>You can customize the theme if you&rsquo;d like but it might be fun select one with your mom.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Point the domain to Tumblr</h2>
<p>Here is <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_domains" target="_blank">Tumblr&rsquo;s guide</a> but I&rsquo;ll provide my own walkthrough.</p>
<p>This part is a little technical but still very easy. You&rsquo;re going to redirect the domain you purchased to Tumblr so that anyone who puts in your mom&rsquo;s URL will see the Tumblr page.  If you registered through Google you may need to wait a little while for the inital purchase to be approved.</p>
<p>First go to the 'blog settings&rsquo; page on Tumblr.  One of the first sections is <strong>URL </strong>which contains a checkbox titled <em>Use a Custom Domain Name </em>check it off and enter the domain you just purchased.</p>
<p>Now you need to go to the domain registrar and change the CNAME.  If you signed up through Google Apps, do the following:</p>
<ol><li>Go the the Google Apps main dashboard</li>
<li>Select the 'Domain Settings&rsquo; tab at the top</li>
<li>Select the 'Domain Names&rsquo; sub-tab&rsquo;</li>
<li>Click 'Advanced DNS Settings&rsquo;</li>
</ol><div><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3q9dqJINc1qc3e3u.gif"/></div>
<p>This should take you to a new page listing your sign-in name, password, and a link 'Sign in to DNS console&rsquo;.  Click the link and sign in.</p>
<p>You now need to find the DNS Manager - this may take a little hunting but shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to find.  It may also be called Zone File Editor.</p>
<p>Change the A-Record to <strong>66.6.44.4 and save.</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now good to go. It may take up to an hour for the changes to be fully implemented but be patient.</p>
<p>After some time, try going to the domain name you purchased - it should take you to the Tumblr page you created.  Good work!</p>
<h2>Step 4: Show Your Mom</h2>
<p>Now that everything is set up, it&rsquo;s time to show your mom what you&rsquo;ve created. Give her the password to her new GMail account (her name @ her domain) and teach her how to use Tumblr (it&rsquo;s very easy).  Now&rsquo;s a good time to help her select a theme for the Tumblr, customize it, and create her first post.</p>
