<p>Continuing on from my <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-06-30-another-summer-of-board-games.html" target="_blank">last post</a> - I&rsquo;ve played four new games this week. Here are some quick thoughts on them.</p>

<h3>Tales of the Arabian Nights</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34119/tales-of-the-arabian-nights" target="_blank">this game</a>, you run around the old world on quests and getting into trouble. The main mechanic involves grabbing paragraphs that are mini-stories and making a quick decision about how you act. For example, you could be caught in a horrible storm and decide to either tough it out, hide, etc.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting premise and the wealth of content (1000+ stories) were impressive but ultimately the game wasn&rsquo;t very engaging / fun. Everything felt extremely arbitrary and there was no sense of agency; I wouldn&rsquo;t play again. I wonder if there&rsquo;s a good way to repurpose the thick book of content created for the game?</p>

<h3>Betrayal at House on the Hill</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill" target="_blank">this game</a>, the players run around a haunted house and random (mostly bad) things happen. Halfway through, one player is selected to be the traitor and the rest are the heroes. Both sides get secret objectives / abilities and the second half of the game has the two sides running around the house, fighting each other, and racing to complete the objectives.</p>

<p>The first part of the game was underwhelming; each turn consisted of entering a random room and having a random event happen - again, no agency, no fun. Once the second part began, thing got a bit more interesting. There was now a bit of tactics and strategy, plus the fun of ganging up another player.</p>

<p>While the second half was better, the game still wasn&rsquo;t great. Despite some light strategy, there still wasn&rsquo;t too much in the way of freedom; i.e. there was usually a clear dominant strategy with little room for creativity. I might play the game once more but I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>

<h3>Once Upon a Time</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1234/once-upon-a-time-the-storytelling-card-game" target="_blank">This game</a> was far and away the best of this week.</p>

<p>Each player gets a hand of cards that contain people, events, places, and aspects (e.g. a prince, a fight, a swamp, ugly) as well as a happily ever after card (e.g. &lsquo;and so the family was reunited&rsquo;). One player starts making up a story and plays cards from their hand when they&rsquo;re mentioned. If they mention something that matches another player&rsquo;s card, that player can play the card and take over the story. The winner is the first to play all their cards and bring the story to their ending.</p>

<p>This game was a blast! We had a lot of fun coming up with absurd stories and got very good at asking leading questions of the storyteller to  make them mention a card we had (e.g. 'So those rich children, were they princes?&rsquo; 'Uhh&hellip; sure&rsquo; 'BAM, prince card&rsquo;). The game felt like structured improv and we didn&rsquo;t play to win as much as have a great time telling a ridiculous story.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already ordered the game off of Amazon and I&rsquo;m excited to play it again soon.</p>
