<p>Last night a few friends and I got to play <a href="http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/ghost-court/" target="_blank">Ghost Court</a> in a US Federal Courtroom - it was amazing!</p><figure data-orig-width="1144" data-orig-height="687" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/add158c8f0206cd735c52e233e31c183/tumblr_inline_otecuv252q1qc3e3u_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1144" data-orig-height="687"/></figure><p>Ghost Court is a wonderful storytelling game that’s basically Judge Judy, with ghosts. It comes with 30 matched Plaintiff / Defendant cases that provide context for each case and a paragraph of info to help the players. Each party then gets one minute to state their case and then the judge has three minutes to ask questions before rendering a verdict.</p><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/80cd7560cb567002c6d7d162dd74ed26/tumblr_inline_oteeh8Biyf1qc3e3u_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768"/></figure><p>The cases are a mix of humans and ghosts and they’re all great set-ups. The format is perfect for beginner roleplayers / larper – many of our players had never done something like this before. Everyone did a great job of getting into character and we were cracking up the whole time!</p><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/afa7602b927fbb71e5f0bdafeb82cea2/tumblr_inline_oteehqAtiI1qc3e3u_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768"/></figure><p>I highly recommend checking out Ghost Court, even if you don’t have a Federal Courtroom on hand!</p>
