<p>The second episode of my podcast, Jamming on Games, is up!</p><p><a href="http://www.jammingongames.com/e/359653ebf61f48/" target="_blank">Episode 2: Biosensors</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="350" data-orig-width="350"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/3481e137e70ec819d32780168561e4f9/tumblr_inline_oy2xwlFV8G1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="350" data-orig-width="350"/></figure><p><br/>I have Nathan Maton on and we talk about using biosensor data in storytelling games.
