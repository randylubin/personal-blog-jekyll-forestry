<p>Short update today. I haven&rsquo;t been putting in nearly as much time as I&rsquo;d like into Nation Building.</p>

<p>This week I built the guts of the Player Decision engine. This allows me to present a decision to the player and have them choose among multiple choices.</p>

<p>The basics are up on the site now, though the choices are just tied to moving onto the next phase. Next step is creating a list of different decisions, random encounters, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>As always you can check out my progress <a href="http://nationbuilding.randylubin.com/" target="_blank">here</a> or look at the code <a href="https://github.com/randylubin/Nation-Building/tree/master/Band%20Expansion" target="_blank">here</a></p>
