<p>This weekend I attended <a href="http://refactorcamp.org/" target="_blank">Refactor Camp</a> and it was amazing.</p>

<p>Refactor Camp is a weekend retreat / unconference thrown by Ventkat Rao of <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/" target="_blank">ribbonfarm</a>. RibbonFarm is a delightfully geeky blog which explores themes of complex systems, civilization, technology, psychology, etc. Venkat also has an online community, of which I&rsquo;ve been a member for a while, which discusses those themes and current articles / events related to them. Refactor Camp is an annual gathering of that community.</p>

<p>This weekend was composed of lightening talks and unconference group sessions. The talks were by attendees and the breakout group topics were chosen by the participants. The venue was the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" target="_blank">Computer History Museum</a>, which proved a great setting for the discussion and the exhibits were a fun break from the main content.</p>

<p>The entire weekend was a blast. The participants were all awesome, the lightening talks were stimulating, and the breakout groups were insightful; the conversations happening in the negative space - between planned events - were all incredible, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t think I learned any major, new concepts but there were still many benefits to attending - beyond the joy of the conversations.</p>

<p>We discussed the upside to analyzing, refactoring the world and developing better models. The consensus, which I agree with, is that it better prepares one to engage with problems and uncertainty as they appear. Pasteur has a quote about fortune favoring the prepared mind; I find analytical exercises, model building, and conceptual refactoring to be excellent at preparing one&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>I gave one of the lightening talks today. The topics was Collaborative Production - something I&rsquo;ve been discussing for ages and been meaning to write a blog post (or several) about. Refactor Camp was a good catalyst to solidify and articulate my thinking. I was extremely pleased with the reception of the talk and the conversation it spurred! I might throw the slides online but I&rsquo;ll probably just translate them into a blog post.</p>

<p>The weekend was excellent and I&rsquo;m looking forward to continuing the discussions, online. On a final note, Refactor Camp made me grateful that I get to have incredible, in-person conversations year round because I&rsquo;m surround by amazing, brilliant people who also like to geek out about everything!</p>
