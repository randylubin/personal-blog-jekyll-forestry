<p>One of my favorite hacks for getting into a productive mindset is putting on <em>Bitches Brew</em> by Miles Davis.  The album has a frenetic, chaotic, energy which pumps me up and keeps me focused.  It&rsquo;s great for any type of work but it&rsquo;s perfect for brainstorm sessions.</p>
<p>The songs are highly unstructured and full of dissonant sounds; they&rsquo;re incredibly interesting and enjoyable.  There are no lyrics to distract me (I rarely work to music with lyrics) and high BPMs keep me energetic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll often mix it up with other jazz or occasionally electronica&hellip;  What works for you?</p>
