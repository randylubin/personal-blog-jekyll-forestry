<p>2012 has been a crazy, awesome year. I joined and sold a company, took my coding to the next level, and finally got hooked on blogging.</p>

<h3>Meetings.io</h3>

<p>I started 2012 still in &ldquo;fun-employment&rdquo; mode:</p>

<ul><li>Consulting for startups</li>
<li>Researching my own ideas</li>
<li>Still learning to code</li>
<li>Taking every opportunity to meet with awesome people building cool products and companies</li>
</ul><p>By late winter, I felt that there was no problem I was extremely excited about solving via my own startup. While I could keep consulting indefinitely, I was eager to work on one problem for an extended time with a great team.</p>

<p>Soon after I heard from the <a href="http://meetings.io" target="_blank">Meetings.io</a> founders, <a href="https://twitter.com/denismars" target="_blank">Denis Mars</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arendn" target="_blank">Arend Naylor</a>. I had consulted for them twice before; I knew they were brilliant entrepreneurs and that I enjoyed working with them. The previous fall I had helped them figure out what Meetings.io should be (it was a pivot) and they had just launched the new product to great acclaim. They were ready to start growing the team and asked me to join as the COO (i.e. &ldquo;Business Guy&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I joined full-time in May and had a blast from day one. My day-to-day ranged from Finance to Marketing, Strategy to PR, and I was even committing a bit of code each week. There was a wide diversity of intellectual challenges and I got to use all parts of the MBA; it was wonderful.</p>

<p>My midsummer we launched a salvo of new features including screen-share, file transfer, and a host of backend upgrades that let us punch through corporate firewalls. The new features were well received and we got a new round of good press.</p>

<p>Before long, we were hearing from companies interested in acquiring us. The acquisition journey was incredibly interesting and I was very active in the entire process. I&rsquo;ll save the details for a later post but it was a fantastic learning experience and a lot of fun; I really like negotiations.</p>

<p>On November 5th we officially sold to Jive Software to become their real-time team; I stayed on as the Product Manager. I spent the remainder of the year managing Meetings.io&rsquo;s transition and creating the roadmap for next year.</p>

<p>From joining Meetings.io to the sale it was just over five months - pretty crazy, but that&rsquo;s what the pace can be in San Francisco. I&rsquo;m definitely grateful for the experience.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>I started 2012 with an okay foundation in programming concepts and some comfort with model-view-controller. Early in the year I picked up Node.js and immediately loved it. My favorite experiment with Node.js was a <a href="http://karma.randylubin.com/" target="_blank">data visualization site</a> for one&rsquo;s Reddit karma (in collaboration with (Chris Maury)[http://chrismaury.com])
. Making the site took a synthesis of much of what I had already learned; having finished it, I felt that I could prototype most ideas I might have.</p>

<p>Another coding experiment was an ecosystem using Processing - a computer language built for dynamic, electronic artwork. <a href="http://randylubin.com/ecosystem/index.html" target="_blank">Ecosystem</a> featured plants, herbivores, and carnivores, which ran around eating each other in a virtual terrarium. It was a lot of fun to make and involved some rudimentary AI. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t work with all versions of Java so you may not be able to view it with the above link.</p>

<p>After joining Meetings.io, I was coding a lot less but still got my hands dirty each week with a little bit of HTML/CSS/JS for Meetings.io&rsquo;s front end. I&rsquo;m hoping to code more often in 2013.</p>

<h3>Blogging</h3>

<p>2012 was the year I finally started blogging. Full credit goes to <a href="http://iron-blogger-sf.com/" target="_blank">Iron Blogger</a> for giving me some social pressure. I wrote 59 posts total and only missed a few weeks.</p>

<p>I covered a large swath of topics including <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-06-25-fixing-unemployment-part-3.html" target="_blank">economics</a>, <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-10-01-board-games-and-the-mechanics-of-fun.html" target="_blank">board games</a>, and <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-11-04-a-new-type-of-entrepreneurship.html" target="_blank">entrepreneurship</a>. Blogging helped me articulate my own thoughts and led to some great conversations with old friends and the start of some great new friendships.</p>

<p>I also did daily blog posts during my trip to Japan. Two great benefits of this were</p>

<ol><li>I took way more pictures than I otherwise would (I&rsquo;m notorious for not taking pictures)</li>
<li>I now have a great record of my trip</li>
</ol><p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdv2ywvwHq1qc3e3u.jpg" alt="Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine"/></p>

<p>I aim to continue my blogging in 2013 and hopefully exceed the quality and quantity from 2012. You can check out all my posts in the <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/archive" target="_blank">archive</a>.</p>

<h3>Social</h3>

<p>I continue to love living in San Francisco. There&rsquo;s an incredible concentration of awesome people who are trying to change the world and have funding to do so. I&rsquo;ve met so many great people and had so many cool, geeky conversations; there&rsquo;s an endless amount of amazing events, parties, brainstorms, game nights, and concerts. This is, by far, the greatest city for me.</p>

<p>One of my favorite moments was at Treasure Island Music Festival this fall. Best Coast had taken the stage and they were rocking <em>The Only Place</em>. I was gazing over the SF skyline at sunset, surrounded by good friends, as the lead singer belted out:</p>

<p>&gt; ♩ Why would you live anywhere else? ♩
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; ♩ This is the only place for me ♩</p>

<p>2012 was an amazing year - I&rsquo;m excited to make 2013 even better.</p>
