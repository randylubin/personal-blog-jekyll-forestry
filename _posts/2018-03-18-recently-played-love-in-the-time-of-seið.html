<p>Last week I had a chance to play the storytelling game <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/190614/Love-in-the-Time-of-Sei" target="_blank">Love in the Time of Seið</a> with its co-designer Jason Morningstar and it was a lot of fun!</p><p>The game focuses on intense character drama among five powerful characters in a Norse-inspired fantasy kingdom. It’s a very tight setup with a cast pointed at each other’s throats in ways guaranteed to result in interesting plot.</p><p> I played the King who was marrying his daughter off to a treacherous neighboring noble. By the end of the game, most of the characters were dead (mine included) but the Princess had become Queen and the kingdom was pointed toward a positive future.<br/></p><p>The lightweight mechanics are based on <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/archipelago-iii/" target="_blank">Archipelago</a>, which I had been wanting to try for a while. The core of the game is players setting interesting scenes for each other and playing them out until somebody says “It’s not that easy” and you flip over a card that determines if succeed and if there are consequences. This led to fluid, improvisational play with just a touch of randomness to keep us on our toes. It was great!</p><p>I highly recommend playing this (or Archipelago) if you have a chance. I look forward to playing its sibling game <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/190572/Love-in-the-Time-of-Khvareneh" target="_blank">Love in the Time of Khvareneh</a> sometime soon!</p>
