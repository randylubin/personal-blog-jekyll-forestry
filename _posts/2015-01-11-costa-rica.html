<p>I was lucky enough to spend the first week of 2015 in Costa Rica with my family.</p>

<p>We stayed in Monteverde - up in the mountains - for the first few days and it was very cool. We explored the tropical cloud forest and saw interesting flora and fauna.</p>

<p>We also toured a farm that had sugar cane, cacao, and coffee and got to sample all three throughout the production process.</p>

<p>While in the mountains, we also toured the canopy via bridges and zip-line. I was skeptical about the zip-lining at first but it turned out to be a lot of fun. The highlights were a 1.5 km zip-line high with a great view of the valley and a &lsquo;Tarzan Swing&rsquo; with ~12 stories of freefall and then a swing out over the trees.</p>

<p>Another fun moment from Monteverde was joining a musician for a quick jam session after dinner.</p>

<p>After Monteverde we went to Playa Conchal, a beach on the west coast. It was pretty but there wasn&rsquo;t much to do. However, there were some cool birds and lizards.</p>
