<p>I just returned from a quick trip to St. Louis where I taught a coding bootcamp at Washington University.</p>

<p>It was great to be back on campus and I had a blast teaching. The course was all day Saturday and a half day Sunday. It was geared for people who had never coded before and only two of the 22 attendees had tried HTML before.</p>

<p>The weekend covered the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also taught how to incorporate Bootstrap to help with the design. My goal was to have the students finish the weekend with a personal website that was live on GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>We packed in a lot of content but the students took to it quickly. They successfully completed their sites but we had trouble with GitHub due to the DDoS attacks - hopefully the sites will be live soon.</p>

<p>The weekend was exhausting but incredibly fun. My brother was there to coteach with me - it was a treat. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be back out this fall to teach it again.</p>
