<p>Avital and I just had a three day layover in Shanghai on our way to Sri Lanka and it was delicious!</p><p>Most of our itinerary involved walking from one restaurant to another and getting a sense of the city along the way. This was my first trip to Shanghai (and mainland China) and I was very impressed. The city was very clean and walkable, the public transit was great, and it was easy to get around without knowing any Mandarin (though Avital knew a bunch and that helped).</p><p>We stayed in a great AirBnB on Nanjing West Road, near the French Concession - it made it easy to walk everywhere. As soon as we arrived, we went out for Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings). They were pretty tasty, though with thicker dough than I prefer.</p><figure data-orig-width="768" data-orig-height="1024" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/40c77cccd0f3c67dbd79255134266646/tumblr_inline_o09bwzmE5H1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-width="768" data-orig-height="1024"/></figure><p>We had a bunch of dumplings over the course of the week and I’m a little embarrassed to say my favorite were at a branch of Din Tai Fung (the awesome Taiwanese chain I’ve mentioned before).</p><p>We’ve had a lot of great dishes over the past few days.
