<p><i>A friend of mine is going to run an RPG soon, for the first time as a GM (game master). He asked me for advice on a system and the following was my response:</i></p><p>Picking a system is always tricky. The two biggest considerations are theme and complexity. Then, there&rsquo;s decision of whether to use a pre-made module or make things up on the fly.<br/></p><p>For a one-shot (stand alone session), I&rsquo;d avoid a high complexity system as it takes too long for players to spin up on the rules.</p><p>When I started GMing (last December), I used pre-written modules as it reduced some of the creative burden. Since then I&rsquo;ve run a bunch of sessions ad hoc, collaboratively creating the adventure on the fly. The ad hoc sessions are a lot of fun but lean heavily on the GMs improve abilities.</p><p>Let me know where you&rsquo;re leaning and I can send followup materials / resources. Here are some things to get you thinking:</p><p>I started with two beginner boxes (starter sets aimed for new GMs)</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-edge-of-the-empire-beginner-game/" target="_blank">Edge of the Empire Beginner Box</a> - Star Wars one-shot with medium complexity and high quality material - a great introduction; I&rsquo;ve run it a few times</li><li><a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_starterset" target="_blank">D&amp;D 5e Starter Set</a> - I used this for a five-session campaign and it was awesome</li></ul><p>If you&rsquo;re into the Star Wars theme, there are two other beginner boxes, a <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-age-of-rebellion-beginner-game/" target="_blank">Rebel</a> one and a <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-force-and-destiny-beginner-game/" target="_blank">Jedi</a> one. I haven&rsquo;t played them but I&rsquo;ve heard good things.</p><p>After running those first few campaigns, I ran bunch of sessions using <a href="http://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/" target="_blank">Dungeon World</a> - the system you played. The first several times I used this excellent <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ypjtlHfcwqrU_-x4b7o0e8tZ_dN2TiNLUu48MLAw7Y/edit?hl=en&amp;forcehl=1#heading=h.t8tfotiv4mt1" target="_blank">no-prep one-shot guide</a>; there&rsquo;s definitely an art to pulling off a no-prep one-shot and I suggest building up your GMing skill a bit before trying it. I&rsquo;ve also ran a few Dungeon World one-shots with modules, including the one we played together, <a href="http://www.johnzo.com/indigo-galleon.pdf" target="_blank">Indigo Galleon</a>. There are plenty more modules out there and I can point you toward some good ones.</p><p>Other things I&rsquo;ve tried include:</p><ul><li><a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf" target="_blank">Lasers and Feelings</a> extremely rules-light no-prep space adventure<br/></li><li><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" target="_blank">Lady Blackbird</a> magical / steampunk one shot with bit of worldbuilding and story arc. I haven&rsquo;t played it but my friend ran a modified version as a 60&rsquo;s era super spy game.</li><li><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/" target="_blank">Fiasco</a> - GMless chaos that plays out like a Coen brothers movie</li></ul>
