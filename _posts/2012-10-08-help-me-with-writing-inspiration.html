<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been struggling to find interesting topics to write about for my weekly blog posts. I have a few long form essays I&rsquo;ve been thinking about but there&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m passionate about typing up.</p>
<p>My favorite posts tend to be inspired by interesting conversations I have with others. If we&rsquo;ve talked about something recently which you think would make a good post - let me know! If there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve brought up in the past that you think the internet would appreciate - bug me to write it up!</p>
<p>Also - if we happen to disagree on something, it could be fun to write up opposing blog posts to make our case&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments or shoot me an email.</p>
