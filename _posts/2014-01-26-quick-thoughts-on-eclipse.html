<p>Today I played a board game called <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> for the first time in ages.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/848944dc6cde078048f006d4b4b9baec/tumblr_inline_n01ssiFquE1qc3e3u.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible space exploration / conquest game that fits in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X" target="_blank">4X genre</a>. It&rsquo;s epic in scope and there are myriad ways to win (research, warfare, colonization). It also scales very well from one to six players.</p>

<p>4X games have their roots in video games (e.g. Masters of Orion) tend to be incredibly complex, relying on computers to handle all of the information / calculations. Eclipse does an amazing job of condensing the mechanics into a very manageable set of rules, boards, and pieces. Especially impressive is how the game conveys current stats. The player mats are set up so that a quick glimpse reveals current economy, strength of ships, researched techs, etc - all easily digestible. Further, whenever an action is taken, the action to carry it out automatically updates or reveals the stats. It&rsquo;s a little tough to describe in words but it effectively consolidates two task (act and update) to one.</p>

<p>Anyhow - it&rsquo;s an extremely well crafted game and a lot of fun for any number of players. It currently holds the 7th spot on BGG&rsquo;s list of best games of all time - rightfully so. There is an iOS version which is pretty decent, though flipping hex tiles to build a galaxy in person is very fun.</p>

<p>Check it out!</p>
