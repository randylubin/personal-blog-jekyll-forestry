<p>Avital and I are <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2019-03-03-konnichiwa-from-japan.html" target="_blank">living in Japan this spring</a> and we’re building a long list of fun and quirky activities. We’ve also designed a system where you can assign “quests” for us to go on.</p><p>Example quests:</p><ul><li>Play VR Mario Cart at one of the big VR centers</li><li>Sleepover in a museum on the art island of Naoshima</li><li>Find the best mochi in Tokyo</li></ul><p>Quests can be as general or specific as you want! There’s room to fill in extra details, links, or addresses. </p><p>You can <a href="https://airtable.com/shr6WaZyXVxro77HR?prefill_Quest+Status=Proposed" target="_blank">use this form</a> to submit a new quest.</p><p>And you also look at our <a href="https://airtable.com/shr1Fm2WXoWoWOusc" target="_blank">progress toward completing quests</a>.</p><p>So help us find some fun things to do! If we complete one of your quests, we’ll let you know and maybe send a photo.</p>
