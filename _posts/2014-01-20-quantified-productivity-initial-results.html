<p>Following on <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-01-06-2014-goals.html" target="_blank">last weeks post</a>:</p>

<p>Last week and this week I&rsquo;m measuring how I spend my time. I&rsquo;ve decided to use <a href="https://www.toggl.com/" target="_blank">Toggl</a> which has both mobile, web, and desktop apps.</p>

<p>The app is pretty good and allows projects, sub-projects, tags, etc. It&rsquo;s all manual though, as opposed to RescueTime which passively tracks which sites you spend time on. However, Toggl is free.</p>

<p>Just measuring the time I was spending had a positive impact on my productivity. Starting late this week or next, I&rsquo;ll end each day by setting time goals for the following day, broken down by project. Hopefully this will yield even better outputs&hellip;</p>
