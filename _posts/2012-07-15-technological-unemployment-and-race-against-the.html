<p>This week I read an awesome short book: <a href="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/" target="_blank">Race Against the Machine</a> by McAfee and Brynjolfsson. They dive into accelerating technological change, technological unemployment, and the future of the economy, and then make recommendations as to how we need to adapt. I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>For my regular readers, it&rsquo;s like a highly articulate and well cited version of my previous posts <em>Fixing Unemployments Parts <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-06-04-fixing-unemployment-part-1.html" target="_blank">One</a>, <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-06-11-fixing-unemployment-part-2.html" target="_blank">Two</a>, and <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-06-25-fixing-unemployment-part-3.html" target="_blank">Three</a></em>. If you enjoyed those posts or are at all interested in the massive disruptive change we&rsquo;ll encounter in the near future - it&rsquo;s worth a read.</p>
<p>The only problem I have with the book is the recommendations section. The recommendations fall into four catagories:</p>
<ul><li>Education</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship</li>
<li>Investment (Infrastructure and R&amp;D)</li>
<li>Laws, Regulations, and Taxes</li>
</ul><p>The actual suggestions are very good and, if politicians (many of the suggestions need political buy-in) were to implement them, our society would be much better prepared for the impact of accelerating technological change. However, the authors don&rsquo;t map out how to get the government to implement the recommendations.</p>
<p>Give the current state of national politics and corporate lobbying, many of their recommendations would be tough to pass through congress - the short term costs (loss of lobbying money or good will of the electorate) are too high.</p>
<p>It would be great to see a pragmatic guide to implementing the recommendations that takes into account today&rsquo;s political realities and uses a systems approach, accounting for all of the stakeholders. Ideally it would articulate:</p>
<ul><li>What new narratives should be conveyed to which stakeholders</li>
<li>Which existing organizations, lobbies, and activists groups to court as allies</li>
<li>What new movements need to be created what new memes should be propagated amongst the general populous</li>
<li>Which media channels should be targeted to gain support for the recommendations</li>
</ul><p>If anything like this already exists - send it my way!</p>
