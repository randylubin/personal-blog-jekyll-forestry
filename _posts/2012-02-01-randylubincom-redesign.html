<p>Just finished redesigning <a href="http://randylubin.com" title="randylubin.com" target="_blank">randylubin.com</a> using <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter&rsquo;s Bootstrap</a></p>
<p>Bootstrap makes it incredibly easy to throw a well structured site together.  I took advantage of their scaffolding and navigation components; they also have some awesome, easy buttons.</p>
<p>Right now the site is independent from this blog but I might integrate them down the road.  I also want to overhaul this blog&rsquo;s design&hellip; perhaps create my own tumblr theme.</p>
<p>Any feedback is appreciated!</p>
