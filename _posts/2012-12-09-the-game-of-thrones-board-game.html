<p>I&rsquo;ve been posting a lot about boardgames recently (<a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/archive" target="_blank">archive</a>); I want to get back to blogging about tech stuff but one more game post, for now.</p>



<p>Today we played an epic six player session of the Game of Thrones <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=172" target="_blank">board game</a>. Each player took over one of the great houses and we battled to see who would control Westeros. We&rsquo;d been hearing great things about it for a while but I was reticent to by it because the game can take up to six hours to play and I doubted we could get six people to commit the time.</p>



<p>I bought it last week and we finally got six to commit this afternoon. I&rsquo;m glad we did because it was an awesome game. It took us about five hours of play plus one hour of learning the rules. The game was actually cut a bit short because people had to leave but I don&rsquo;t think it would have taken much longer to finish.</p>



<p>The game itself is a great mix of mechanics:</p>



<ul><li>Risk-like attack andÂ defense</li>
<li>Area control and support</li>
<li>Bluffing</li>
<li>Alliances and Betrayals</li>
<li>Cooperation (against Wildling attacks)</li>
</ul><p>It&rsquo;s insanely complicated and has a steep learning curve but it is incredibly fun.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ll definitely be playing again and if you&rsquo;re up for the challenge you should definitely check it out.</p>
