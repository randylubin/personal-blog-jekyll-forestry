<p>It&rsquo;s been another great year! This post will be a quick summary of what I&rsquo;ve been up and some highlights.</p>

<h3>Professional</h3>

<p>I spent the first eight months at Jive - post Meetings.io acquisition. I learned a lot there and hopefully made an impact. Ultimately, I missed the start-up life and left in September. Since leaving I&rsquo;ve been hacking on side projects, exploring startup ideas, and doing some pro bono consulting for a non-profit.</p>

<p>My coding ability keeps improving - my <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-10-06-weekend-project-acting-karaoke.html" target="_blank">favorite project</a> involved real time video (WebRTC), synchronized data (Firebase), and a front end framework (Angular). I feel empowered to prototype just about anything, fairly quickly.</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve moved to an amazing apartment (still in the Mission) with a really great community. There are three of us in our place and we have four friends next door (over a stepladder to get between our roof decks).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;ve been plenty of board games and I am working on one of my own (keep an eye out for future posts). Games remain one of my favorite ways of hanging out with friends.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing lots of guitar, thanks to Rocksmith. I even got to play on stage in front of ~100 people! I&rsquo;m very happy with how my skill is progressing.</p>

<p>I undertook some fun travel - highlights were a weekend trip to Mexico City and a week in the UK which involved a hackathon on a plane and a meeting with the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>This is my 46th blog post this year. I&rsquo;ve hit every week that Iron Blogger was in session - the social pressure really helps! My favorite posts were <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-11-25-my-cognitive-exoskeleton-is-atrophying-my-brain.html" target="_blank">Cognitive Exoskeleton</a> and <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-12-02-laws-and-norms-complexity-and-reputation.html" target="_blank">Laws vs Norms</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been an awesome year and I&rsquo;m looking forward to making 2014 even better!</p>
