<p>My weeks are filled with opportunities to brainstorm, build, and collaborate. Recently, I&rsquo;ve thought a bit abut the criteria I use to choose to be productive. Here&rsquo;s some of my filtering:</p>

<p><strong>Brainstorms:</strong> I thoroughly enjoy exploring ideas. I&rsquo;ll brainstorm with most people about almost any idea - as long as it&rsquo;s not too malicious / evil.</p>

<p><strong>Small Projects:</strong> There are many reasons I&rsquo;ll dive into small projects (weekend hacks or slightly larger). It could be to learn a new concept / framework, to create something awesome, to enjoy the process, or to collaborate with someone great. If the project strongly hits one of the buckets or moderately hits several, I&rsquo;m likely to engage.</p>

<p><strong>Start-up Ideas:</strong> I&rsquo;m much more discerning about exploring ideas around which I might found a company (and raise funding). Some of my criteria include:</p>

<ol><li>Large addressable market: one of my professors is fond of saying &ldquo;It takes as much energy to start a small business as a giant one&rdquo;</li>
<li>Solving a real problem: increases chances for success and my own motivation</li>
<li>Positive social impact: I believe that if you have the capacity to change the world, you have an obligation to try</li>
<li>Interesting; something I get excited about for <em>years</em></li>
<li>&ldquo;But for&rdquo; causation: if it&rsquo;s likely to happen without me, I&rsquo;m less motivated to build it; I consider the problem &ldquo;solved&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
