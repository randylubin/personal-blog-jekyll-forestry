<p>This winter I’ll be heading to back to India for <a href="http://www.pngrowth.com/" target="_blank">PN Growth</a> - another fun experiment in the vein of Innovate Delhi. This time I’ll be in Bangalore and Mysore, working with companies that have a little revenue and are looking to scale.</p><p>As a pre-trip, Avital and I will be spending three days in Shanghai and a week in Sri Lanka. Neither of us have been to Sri Lanka before and we’d love some tips. If you’ve been before, please send us recommendations for food, lodging, hiking, etc!</p>
