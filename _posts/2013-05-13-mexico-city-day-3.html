<p>Day three of our trip to Mexico City, following <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-05-12-mexico-city-day-2.html" target="_blank">Day 2</a></p>

<p>We woke up early this morning to beat the rush to Teotihuacan. The ancient city is about an hour north of Mexico City and we arrived by 9am.</p>

<p>The three of us at the Pyramid of the Sun

<p>The ruins of Teotihuacan were ancient even at the time of the Aztecs. Most impressive are the two large Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon. It&rsquo;s interesting to imagine what it would have been like for pre-columbian peoples to have stumbled upon the massive structures.</p>

<p>After thoroughly exploring the complex and museum we grabbed lunch at La Gruta - a mexican restaurant in a cave near the ruins. The meal was delicious; we ate lamb barbacoa and nopales (cactus).

<p>Upon returning to Mexico City, we had a beer tasting at a local bar and found some tasty new brews.

<p>We rounded out the day with dinner at Koi - a Japanse-Mexican fusion restaurant. Like all our other meals this trip, it was great.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning, we catch an early flight back to SF. This was an excellent trip - we toured amazing museums, ate excellent food, and got a good sense of Mexico City. Travelling with Adam and Sara was a blast and we&rsquo;re already scheming about future trips!</p>
