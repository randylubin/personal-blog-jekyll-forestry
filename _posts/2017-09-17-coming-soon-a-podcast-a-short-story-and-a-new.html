<p>I just want to quickly tease three things I’m working on and hope to release soon:</p><h2>Podcast: Jamming on Games</h2><p>I’m starting a podcast, tentatively titled Jamming on Games. It’ll consist of a few things:</p><ul><li>Inviting designers on and helping them develop their game or asking them to help with a game I’m developing<br/></li><li>Creating a new game on air, by making up the rules as we go</li><li>Promoting and discussing ongoing game jams, ideas for submissions, and analysis of the winners</li></ul><p>I’ve recored the first session and hope to edit and post it later this week!</p><h2>Short Story</h2><p>This morning I wrote a short story heavily inspired by the magical realism of Jose Luis Borges. I met with a good friend who was also working on a story and we workshoped each other’s work. I’m aiming to edit it in the next day or two and post it here on my site.</p><h2>New Game</h2><p>I’m working on a submission for <a href="http://www.goldencobra.org/" target="_blank">Golden Cobra</a>, the larp writing competition and it’s about people watching. I’ve playtested it and received solid feedback. I just need to make some final edits and then work on the visual design. The deadline is the 26th but I hope to finish it even sooner! </p>
