<p>I&rsquo;m extremely excited to announce that I&rsquo;m helping with <a href="http://www.innovatedelhi.com/" target="_blank">Innovate Delhi</a> this June!</p>

<p>Innovate Delhi is a three week entrepreneurial bootcamp run by two friends at Stanford - Professor <a href="https://twitter.com/shariqueorg" target="_blank">Sharique Hasan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/orgRem" target="_blank">Rem Koning</a>. They&rsquo;re awesome and are trying something bold with this program. They&rsquo;ll be training 200 top Indian students in entrepreneurship and collecting great data on innovation and collaboration.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m flattered that they&rsquo;ve asked me to help and I look forward to contributing. I&rsquo;ll be advising them on curriculum and then teaching at least one session when we get to Delhi. I&rsquo;ll also be mentoring the student teams as they refine their business plans.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to India and am extremely excited to visit. The official program is June 1st to the 22nd but I&rsquo;ll likely fly over a few weeks early and take some side trips. A current contender is a train up to Nepal and then east to Darjeeling. Let me know if you have any advice!</p>

<p>This is going to be an excellent program and I&rsquo;m honored to help out. I&rsquo;m also thrilled to finally visit India. I&rsquo;ll be posting more info as I figure out my itinerary. As always, I&rsquo;ll blog a lot when I&rsquo;m actually traveling.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be awesome!</p>
