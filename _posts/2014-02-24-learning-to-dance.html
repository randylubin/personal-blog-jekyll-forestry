<p>This month I&rsquo;ve been learning to dance. For years, I&rsquo;ve been totally clueless on the dance floor. Many of my SF friends have been doing swing or blues dancing and loving it.</p>

<p>I signed up for a four session Lindy Hop program with a few friends. It&rsquo;s been meeting every Wednesday in the Mission and the lessons are geared for beginners. There are swing lessons afterwards but I haven&rsquo;t made it there yet.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;m enjoying the lessons and it&rsquo;s not as tricky as I expected. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll take more lessons next month but I probably will at some point. I highly recommend giving it a shot!</p>
