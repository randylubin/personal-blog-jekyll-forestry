<p>I’ve been excited to discover Japan’s immersive / interactive theater scene and there’s been scant information on the English web. This week we tried two immersive experiences: <a href="https://borderless.teamlab.art/" target="_blank">TeamLab Borderless</a> and <a href="https://www.shochiku.co.jp/pj/kabukinohikari/" target="_blank">The Lighting Art of Kabuki</a><br/></p><h2>TeamLab Borderless</h2><div>Borderless was an extremely high production value immersive space spread over two floors and myriad exhibits. Most exhibits involved interesting animated art projected on walls with varying degrees of interactivity.<br/></div><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ccee237f58d36701b167dabb726eb5e/tumblr_inline_poswhrLrtG1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>One highlight was a tea room where digital flowers grow out of your tea cup and the petals flow around the room.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/23c2ade71b6c49f7403dab4e7ddfd670/tumblr_inline_poswkcCuQs1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>There was a mirrored room with dozens of synchronized spotlights that danced around and reacted to the attendees.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/970019ffb0f1390d47d5768a80402fb1/tumblr_inline_poswm9McnQ1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>And a hybrid virtual and analog town where the roads and rails would rearrange themselves as you moved around buildings.</p><p>Almost all of our friends raved about their visits to Borderless. Although I enjoyed it, I didn’t love it. I would have appreciated more narrative, more integration across installations, and even more interactivity. Overall though great to see experimentation on this scale!<br/><br/></p><h2>The Lighting and Art of Kabuki</h2><div>This was a small exhibit in Shibuya where a team of artists retold a classic Kabuki story through interactive digital means. The focused on a few key beats of the story and used a different interactive mechanism for each.<br/><br/></div><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b72c244fcd8eb596b30efc4e9b3d1c4/tumblr_inline_poswu0xe7G1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>In one area, we carried lanterns (tea lights on top of Vive controllers) which illuminated a scene animated through shadows. The shadows reacted in real-time to us moving around the lantern, which was a pretty cool effect.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/0890bb729c7a6849adabce3a20670359/tumblr_inline_poswx4yZay1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>Another allowed audience members to puppeteer characters and make them dance around (using Kinect), while a third area used holographic pedestals to let folks play a virtual drum.<br/><br/>Overall, the experience felt more like a string of thematically linked tech demos than a narratively coherent interactive experience but it was still nice to check out.<br/><br/>We’ll be looking for more interactive experiences to check out so let us know if you find any!</p>
