<p>A few weekends ago I had the pleasure of participating in Hype Up Weekend.  It was a one day faux-hackathon where the goal was to produce funny landing pages to products that will never be built.</p>
<p>I teamed up with the always awesome Katie Johnson to build <a href="http://ditchtheconference.com/" target="_blank">Ditch the Conference</a> a service which sends a surrogate in your place so you can skip boring conventions and go have fun.</p>
<p>Phase two was to generate hype around our ideas - while pretending they&rsquo;re real. While we didn&rsquo;t get any press coverage for our idea, one of the other teams did. <a href="http://www.shockbottoms.com/" target="_blank">ShockBottoms</a> was able to get press on <a href="http://www.betabeat.com/2012/04/16/shockbottoms-sweatpants-darfur-che-04162012/" target="_blank">BetaBeat</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, a very fun experience&hellip; I&rsquo;d love to do something like it again.  Thanks go to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gregmarra" target="_blank">Greg Marra</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/timhwang" target="_blank">Tim Hwang</a> for organizing!</p>
