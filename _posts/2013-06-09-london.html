<p>I&rsquo;m heading to London this week as part of <a href="http://ungroundedthinking.com" target="_blank">ungroundedthinking.com</a></p>

<p>You can read more about the trip through that link but the short of it:  British Airways is flying out 100 entrepreneurs from the Bay Area to brainstorm ways to change the world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be staying through the 23rd and taking a mid-week trip to Edinburgh for fun. I&rsquo;ll try to blog about it while in country but probably won&rsquo;t make time for the daily posts, like my last few trips.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly excited for this - it&rsquo;ll be my first time back in London since I lived there in 2008.</p>
