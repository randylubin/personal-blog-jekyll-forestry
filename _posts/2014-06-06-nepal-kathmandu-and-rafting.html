<p>Our Nepal trip started in Pokhara and included amazing trekking in the Annapurna region (blogged about <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-06-01-trekking-in-nepal-days-one-and-two.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-06-03-trekking-in-nepal-days-three-and-four.html" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

<p>Having completed our trek, our next destination was Kathmandu. Originally, we planned to fly but then found a better option - rafting. We signed up for a few hour rafting trip with <a href="http://www.paddlenepal.com/" target="_blank">Paddle Nepal</a> on the Trisuli River - half way between Pokhara and Kathmandu.</p>

<p>The rafting was fun, if a bit easy. We spent maybe three hours on the river with a break for lunch in the middle. The rapids were 3s and 4s - not too rough.</p>

<p>That night we arrived in Kathmandu and checked into our hotel - Mums House - in the tourist neighborhood: Thamel. Kathmandu is probably the least developed major city I&rsquo;ve visited. Many of the streets were unpaved, traffic was chaos, and building codes looked questionable. Still - the city was easily navigable, the food was tasty, and everyone we met was friendly.</p>

<p>Our itinerary was well informed by <a href="http://www.alan-perlman.com/" target="_blank">Alan Perlman</a> who studied abroad there. His recommendations were great, including food - Third Eye, OR2K, Fire and Ice (all excellent) and sight seeing (everything below).</p>

<p>The next day we set out for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swayambhunath" target="_blank">Swayambhunath</a>, also know as the Monkey Temple, a sacred Buddhist site. It was an easy walk from Thamel, though there were plenty of stairs at the end (and lots of monkeys)!</p>

<p>Next we caught a taxi to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boudhanath" target="_blank">Boudhanath</a> - an enormous Buddhist stupa.</p>

<p>After ambling around a bit we walked south to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashupatinath_Temple" target="_blank"> Pashupatinath Temple</a> - a Hindu temple complex, the most sacred dedicated to Shiva.</p>

<p>Only Hindus are allowed inside the main temple but we explored outside and took in the architecture.</p>

<p>The Bagmati River runs through the center of the complex and its banks are popular for cremations. We sat and watched several cremation ceremonies take place; it was fascinating to watch the rituals involved as they wrapped the deceased and prepared the pyre. When only ash remained, attendants swept it into the river.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take any photos but there is one on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashupatinath_Temple#mediaviewer/File:Pashupatinath_Cremation.jpg" target="_blank">Wikimedia</a> if you are curious.</p>

<p>Our final sightseeing was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbar_Square" target="_blank">Durbar Square</a>, which contains an old royal palace complex and other buildings. It was nice to walk around - some the buildings had incredible woodworking.</p>

<p>The final bit of sightseeing was at the the Narayanhiti Palace Museum - the seat of the Nepali monarchy for the later half of the 20th century.</p>

<p>Our final night in Kathmandu we were fortunate to have a wonderful dinner with some local entrepreneurs. We met with Sakar Pudasaini, founder of <a href="http://www.karkhana.asia/" target="_blank">Karkhana</a>, an awesome startup teaching Maker skills to students in Kathmandu. After showing us around the marker space and offices, he took us to his parents house for dinner.</p>

<p>There we were joined by Sushil Khadka, who is scaling the first Nepali <a href="http://www.bajekosekuwa.com/" target="_blank">fast food franchise</a> and his wife Shilshila Acharya who is running a <a href="http://hamribahini.org/" target="_blank">green social enterprise that is empowering women</a>.</p>

<p>The conversation was great - all three entrepreneurs have had fascinating journeys. They&rsquo;ve all given up big careers / opportunities in the west to return to Nepal and make an impact. They noted that the entrepreneurship scene was still nascent and the ecosystem had a long way to grow. However, they were extremely optimistic and felt that in 5-10 years Nepal would become an amazing place for entrepreneurs. They were thrilled to be the ones building the ecosystem and working toward that time.</p>

<p>Conversation lasted late into the night and the food, cooked by Sakar&rsquo;s mother, was delicious. It was the perfect way to end our time in Nepal!</p>
