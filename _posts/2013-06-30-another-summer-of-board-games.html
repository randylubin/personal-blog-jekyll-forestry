<p>Last summer I got pretty <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-10-01-board-games-and-the-mechanics-of-fun.html" target="_blank">hooked</a> on board games. I didn&rsquo;t realize how interesting / awesome modern board games could be.</p>

<p>This summer is shaping up to be board game heavy as well, aided in part by my brother staying with me and always being up to play. So far we&rsquo;ve played 7 Wonders, Munchkins, Arkham Horror, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, and the new Game of Thrones expansion: A Feast For Crows. The last two are new games for me and I&rsquo;m very excited about them.</p>

<p><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104162/descent-journeys-in-the-dark-second-edition" target="_blank">Descent: Journeys in the Dark</a> is an asymmetric game where 1-4 players are heroes and one player is the evil overlord. Each side has very different goals and there&rsquo;s a great mix of strategy and tactics. So far we&rsquo;ve only played one-off &lsquo;quests&rsquo; but the quests can be strung together into campaigns with travelling, shops, and experience in between.</p>

<p>The Game of Thrones expansion, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/140261/a-game-of-thrones-the-board-game-second-edition-" target="_blank">A Feast for Crows</a> changes a few things. It&rsquo;s geared for four players (the original is best with six), it includes House Arryn, and it changes the game from expansion-based to objective-based. Playing with fewer players moved the game a lot faster; we finished under three hours as opposed to the usual six. It did limit the negotiations which was my favorite part of the original. The objectives were a great twist and I really enjoyed pursing them rather than just going for as much land as possible. Overall, I think I prefer the original.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see what else we play soon - I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll stumble across some more excellent games!</p>
