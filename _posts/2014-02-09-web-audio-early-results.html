<p>As per <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-02-02-experimenting-with-html5-web-audio.html" target="_blank">my last post</a>, I&rsquo;ve been playing with WebAudio. So far I&rsquo;ve been loving it - the API is very powerful and there are some great tutorials around the web.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made two little things so far. Both experiments use the WebAudio APIs (should work on everything - including mobile - except IE) - they also use Angular.js and <a href="http://www.createjs.com/#!/EaselJS" target="_blank">Easel.js</a> (a great library for interacting with HTML5 Canvas.</p>

<p><a href="http://randylubin.github.io/Web-Audio-Experiments/#/theremin" target="_blank">The first thing</a> is a Theremin - a crazy electronic instrument usually played with a wand. In my digital version, you drag <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme)" target="_blank">Doge</a> around a canvas to make sound. The Y-axis is frequency and the X-axis is pan (left vs right speaker).</p>

<p><a href="http://randylubin.github.io/Web-Audio-Experiments/#/binaural" target="_blank">The second thing</a> generates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats" target="_blank">Binaural Beats</a> which can <em>supposedly</em> alter your brainwaves to make you more relaxed, alert, or meditative. This, too, is controlled by Doge. If you&rsquo;re going to try it - you MUST use headphones to get the effect.</p>

<p>So far - so fun! The coding has been easy and enjoyable; the learning has come quick. I look forward to continuing the experiments&hellip;</p>
