<p>This week I&rsquo;ve made a lot more progress on my <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-05-05-nation-building-redux.html" target="_blank">civilization building game</a>.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t a fully playable game yet but there&rsquo;s a good chunk of early exploration written. I&rsquo;ve also built several modules which will help me build the rest of the game more quickly.</p>

<p>At the core of the game is a Finite State Machine - the player moves the band through different states via what feels like a choose-your-own-adventure type mechanic. I&rsquo;ve tried to build in some complex systems / loops, though so it feels non-linear / dynamic. I&rsquo;ve also built in some mechanisms for procedural generation of content. In addition to the main state machine, I&rsquo;ve added interrupts for various events.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been building the game in Angular.js and for the most part enjoying it. The framework definitely has its idiosyncrasies but once you get past them it&rsquo;s wonderful for prototyping.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also learning a lot more about Angular best practices. At first I had all the logic in my controller but now I&rsquo;m refactoring it into various services. I&rsquo;m also using <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed" target="_blank"></a> which is a great foundation.</p>

<p>I expect to make more great progress this week and might include a link for early play-testing!</p>
