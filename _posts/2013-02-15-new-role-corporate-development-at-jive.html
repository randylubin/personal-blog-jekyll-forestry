<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce I&rsquo;m transitioning to a role in Corporate Development at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jive_Software" target="_blank">Jive Software</a>. In this role I&rsquo;ll be focused on M&amp;A and partnerships with startups.</p>

<p>Following Jive&rsquo;s acquisition of <a href="http://meetings.io/" target="_blank">Meetings.io</a> in November, I took on the Product Manager role for the new Real Time team. I focused on ensuring a smooth transition and creating an exciting product roadmap. With that accomplished, I&rsquo;m switching into Corporate Development.</p>

<p>Though my new role, I&rsquo;ll be meeting with startups to find awesome opportunities for acquisition or partnership. I really enjoyed the M&amp;A process from the target&rsquo;s perspective and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll like it from the acquirer&rsquo;s side. The partnership angle is great, too; Jive can help startups reach a huge market and scale incredible quickly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to hanging out with tons of great startups. It&rsquo;s something I do already and now there&rsquo;s an extra dimension to focus the conversation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to jump into this new role and think it&rsquo;s going to be a great experience!</p>
