<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to share that my brother Greg has just moved back to SF. He&rsquo;s between his Junior and Senior year at Wash U and, for the third summer in a row, is interning with a startup. The last few summers together have been awesome and I’m looking forward to another great one.</p><p>This summer he&rsquo;s interning with <a href="http://www.peek.com/" target="_blank">Peek</a> and doing a mix of coding and business. I’m hoping we collaborate on a few fun projects this time around. He’ll be blogging again as part of Iron Blogger, hopefully starting next week. You can find his blog here: <a href="http://greglubin.com/" target="_blank">http://greglubin.com/</a></p>
