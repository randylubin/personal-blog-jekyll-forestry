<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting week! My brother Greg just arrived in SF. He just wrapped up his sophomore year at Wash U and is spending his second summer interning in tech in SF! Last summer was amazing and I&rsquo;m looking forward to living and collaborating with him again this year. You can follow his blog at <a href="http://greglubin.com" target="_blank">greglubin.com</a></p>

<p>However, much like last year, I&rsquo;m deserting him in the beginning of the summer for international adventure. This Wednesday I leave for Nepal / India. The trip is still shaping up but it&rsquo;s going to be incredible. As always, I&rsquo;ll be blogging whenever I have internet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be back at the end of June - should be amazing!</p>
