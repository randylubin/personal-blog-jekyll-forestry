<p>The MVP concept is about more than quickly building a product; it&rsquo;s about minimizing time through the <em>build-&gt;measure-&gt;learn</em> loop.  I sense that this is often misunderstood or forgotten.</p>
<p>Here in <em>Startup Land</em>, Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a very popular term.  Most people use it to describe the most pared down site/service that customers will use/buy.  Entrepreneurs debate exactly what counts as <em>minimum</em> or <em>viable</em> but often the conversation&rsquo;s focus is exclusively on features and user needs.  They would do well to remember original thesis of MVP.</p>
<p>The point of the MVP strategy is to gain accurate customer feedback in a speedy manner and to use that information to iterate on the product.  In Eric Ries&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=randylubincom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307887898" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=randylubincom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307887898" width="1"/>, he emphasizes that MVP is about minimizing time through the <em>build-&gt;measure-&gt;learn </em>cycle. When founders focus only on the <em>build</em> component, they may be forfeiting the opportunity to learn.  Without optimizing the entire learning process, they will lack crucial data needed to inform the next iteration of the product.</p>
<p>Next time you&rsquo;re discussing MVP or debating the scope of a new product, remember the importance of learning. </p>
