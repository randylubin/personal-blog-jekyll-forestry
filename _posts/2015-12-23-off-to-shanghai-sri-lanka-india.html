<p>Avital and I are leaving tomorrow for a few weeks in Asia. First up a long layover in Shanghai. I&rsquo;ve never been but Avital lived there for half a year - I&rsquo;m excited to check it out. I think we&rsquo;re going to have dumplings every day.</p><p>Next up is Sri Lanka, We&rsquo;ll be covering a lot of ground, from the mountains to the ocean, with tea plantations in between. We&rsquo;ll be there for just over a week and then Avital heads home while I head on to India.</p><p>I&rsquo;m returning to India with the same group from last summer. We&rsquo;ll be hanging out with startups in Bangalore and then running a startup <a href="http://www.pngrowth.com/" target="_blank">bootcamp </a>nearÂ Mysore. Should be great - especially since the weather will be a balmy 90, compared to the 120 we had in Delhi.</p><p>I hope to be posting lots of updates to the blog, though that depends a lot on internet.</p>
