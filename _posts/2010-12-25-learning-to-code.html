<p>As an aspiring entrepreneur with no programming knowledge I decided to spend winter break learning the basics of coding.  I used the resources in Stanford&rsquo;s CS106a &ldquo;Programming Methodology&rdquo; class to teach myself and completed the course in about two weeks.</p>
<p>I  loved the course and highly recommend it.  It is taught in Java but with the aim of setting students up to quickly learn other languages.</p>
<p>Resources:</p>
<p>Class homepage - <a title="CS 106a Programming Methodology" target="_blank" href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111">CS106a: Programming Methodology</a></p>
<p>Zip of all class material: <a title="Course Materials" target="_blank" href="http://see.stanford.edu/materials/icspmcs106a/ProgrammingMethodologyAllMaterials.zip">Course Materials</a> (link found at bottom of class homepage)</p>
<p>I recommend following the course exactly and doing the assignments along with the class.  I downloaded the videos through iTunes U and watched them at 1.7-2.5x speed through GOM (though you can use Windows Media Player); it made makes the hour long lectures less than 30 min and forced me to focus for the duration.</p>
