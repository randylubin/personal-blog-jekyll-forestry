<p>I arrived in Delhi June 1st to help with <a href="http://www.innovatedelhi.com/" target="_blank">Innovate Delhi Entrepreneurship Academy</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a three week program to teach key skills to budding entrepreneurs. We have about 120 students from across India; many are still in undergrad, some have recently graduated, and several have just quit their jobs. They&rsquo;re all awesome and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed getting to know them so far. Many are already working on their own startups or NGOs.</p>

<p>The program is run by Sharique Hasan (my old professor) and his PhD student Rem Koning. I&rsquo;ve been following / advising the program since they first started noodling on the idea and it&rsquo;s great to see it finally come to fruition.</p>

<p>My role in the program is pretty varied. I&rsquo;m giving lectures, mentoring individuals and teams, and pitching in wherever I can. So far I&rsquo;ve given two main talks.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday I gave a talk on my own entrepreneurial journey and the story of Meetings.io. The talk was a blast to give - I had the stage for two hours and the Q&amp;A would have gone on indefinitely if I didn&rsquo;t have to run to dinner.</p>

<p>Then, last Saturday, I gave a talk on learning to code. There&rsquo;s a balance of technical and non-technical kids in the program and many of the technical kids haven&rsquo;t built web apps before. The talk was optional but the turnout was great. I&rsquo;ll probably post the slides in public at some point. I then created a Facebook group for the students to share their progress, ask for help, and point to great resources; the group is up to 85 members and highly active.</p>

<p>Beyond the talks and the mentoring, I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying the program. The students are all extremely eager to learn, have great startup ideas, and are quick to help each other out. They&rsquo;ve been self-organizing discussion sessions after hours and seem to be having a great time.</p>

<p>One non-educational highlight from the week was the epic Game of Thrones viewing session yesterday evening. The show is just as big here as in the US.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a great first week and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the remaining time here in Delhi!</p>
