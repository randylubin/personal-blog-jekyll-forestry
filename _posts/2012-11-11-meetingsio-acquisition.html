<p>Earlier this week, Meetings.io sold to Jive Software. </p>
<p>As Meetings.io&rsquo;s &ldquo;business guy&quot; I was extremely involved in the deal negotiations and closing process. It was a fascinating experience and I learned a ton. Perhaps in a future post I&rsquo;ll discuss some of the lessons learned throughout the negotiations process. It was also an exhausting journey, about three full months between Jive first reaching out and us closing; we raced to close the deal just hours before Jive&rsquo;s earnings call in which it was announced.</p>
<p>While it feels like I <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/post/23918378977/im-joining-the-meetings-io-team" target="_blank">just started</a>, I think the acquisition was a good decision on the part of our company - maybe I&rsquo;ll delve into the reasons in a future post. Ultimately our team has the chance to affect a lot of change by leveraging Jive&rsquo;s customer base and support. I&rsquo;ll be sticking around Jive as the Product Manager for the Meetings.io / Real Time Communications team.</p>
<p>I started working at Jive last Monday, when we closed the deal. So far I&rsquo;ve been impressed with both the product and the people; everyone I&rsquo;ve met so far seems awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a crazy, fun ride with Meetings.io and it will be very interesting to see what we do next!</p>
