<p>The last couple weeks I&rsquo;ve been trying 100% Food by <a href="http://www.spacenutrientsstation.com/" target="_blank">Space Nutrients Station</a>. 100% Food, like <a href="http://www.soylent.me/" target="_blank">Soylent</a>, is a meal replacement that the perfect balance of nutrients your body needs. Each meal comes in a powdered form in a plastic bottle - all I do is add water and shake.</p>

<p>I been curious about Soylent for a while and have been looking for an alternative to my usual breakfast - dry cereal from a box. I&rsquo;ve tried finding the best cereal to eat but ultimately it&rsquo;s still just cereal and I don&rsquo;t have the patience to cook every morning. 100% Food / Soylent excel at both the ease and health criteria.</p>

<p>My friend Harvey recommended 100% Food and handed me a few bottles to try. The chocolate flavor is delicious; it tastes like Ghirardelli brownie mix. The texture is a bit odd and changes as I keep adding water to the bottle (usually end up refilling as I drink to dilute more of the powder. I don&rsquo;t mind it but others might.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed my first few morning with 100% food, I felt like I had more energy vs my normal cereal routine. The first variant I tried was low-carb, which had a bit too much sugar for me - if I had it for dinner, it would keep me up. Now I&rsquo;m drinking the low-sugar variant which is better for my energy levels.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very glad I switched to 100% Food for most breakfasts. Occasionally I&rsquo;ll have it for lunch, if I&rsquo;m busy and don&rsquo;t want to break from work. I then find my tastebuds heightened if I go out for dinner and all the flavors are much more intense. If you&rsquo;re curious, I definitely recommend checking it out or grabbing a bottle from me!</p>
