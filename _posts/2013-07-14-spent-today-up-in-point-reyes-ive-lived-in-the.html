<p>We (my brother Greg, my roommate Adam, and I) started with an eight mile hike that dropped by Alamere Falls. The falls were nice and we had to do a little bit of climbing / scrambling to get to the beach - which was fun.</p>

<p>After the hike we drove all the way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Reyes_Lighthouse" target="_blank">Point Reyes Lighthouse</a>. It took a long drive to get there but was pretty cool.</p>

<p>All said, a great day of hiking. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get in a few more hikes this summer.</p>
