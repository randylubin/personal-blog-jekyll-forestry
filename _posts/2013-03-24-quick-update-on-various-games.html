<p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks so I wanted to give an update on the various game projects in which I&rsquo;m involved.</p>

<h2>Nation Building</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working on this but haven&rsquo;t been able to put a lot of time into it. First I was distracted by my <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-03-17-results-from-the-listserve-experiment.html" target="_blank">Listserve Project</a> and now I&rsquo;ve been involved with <a href="http://brosephstalin.com/2013/03/12/5322-an-e-mail-based-mmo/" target="_blank">5322</a>, which I&rsquo;ll talk about in a second.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still happy with how Nation Building is progressing. The basic engine is in place but I want to add a few more features before I put the alpha online. The first version is just going to be growing your band until you become a post-agricultural tribe. If I find the time to work, it should get there in a week or two.</p>

<h2>5322</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://brosephstalin.com/" target="_blank">Tim Hwang</a> decided to run an email driven MMO. I was excited to play it but even more thrilled when he asked me to help run it. We have about 40 players now and a federated network of game-runners. Designing and running the game has been a tremendous amount of fun and I&rsquo;m excited to share all the details once the story resolves next week. We&rsquo;ll definitely do a behind the scenes / how-to guide once it&rsquo;s completed.</p>
