<p>I’m now almost two months into learning Japanese and I’m updating my lesson mix again.</p><p>I made it to about 700 memorized Kanji meanings through flashcards (Anki) but ran out of steam&hellip; It just wasn’t engaging enough to stay interesting.</p><p>My main source of lessons now is WaniKani, where I’m up to 250 Kanji (meaning and pronunciation) plus ~650 vocab words.I feel like I’m retaining the vocab better and that the pace is sustainable. I’ll keep posting updates here!</p>
