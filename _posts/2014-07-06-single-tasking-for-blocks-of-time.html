<p>After a week of readjusting to SF life, it&rsquo;s time to get productive. One tactic I&rsquo;m going to try is setting aside serious blocks of time to work on <em>just one thing</em>.</p>

<p>My days are often punctuated with little meetings, calls, side trips, etc that are horrible for getting serious work / thinking done. I&rsquo;m going to start blocking off half-days (maybe three hour chunks) to working without interruption. I&rsquo;ll dedicate these blocks to just one thing - I&rsquo;m hoping the single-tasking will aid in focus and productivity.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll likely experiment with then the optimal time of day during which I can be most productive. I will post my results here!</p>
