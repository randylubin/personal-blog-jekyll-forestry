<p>I’ve been working on a new tabletop RPG, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AizW3DBq47rKsdw7FuUReVJbmCnk5ELLG8KNb7wt6Lw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Hackers and Hustlers</a>. It’s a startup themed farce in near-future San Francisco. It’s still a rough draft but I’d love some feedback. I’ve enabled comments on the Google Doc. If you run a session, I’d love to hear how it goes!</p><blockquote><p><b>It is the very near future. You are coworkers and roommates: running a startup out of an old Victorian in San Francisco, where you also live. Your founders went to Burning Man and refused to return. Malicious forces are at work.</b><br/></p></blockquote><p>Hackers and Hustlers is a remix of <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf" target="_blank">Lasers and Feelings</a>, a lightweight RPG that aims for a Star Trek type space adventure. I had a blast playing it and it was pretty easy to shift the rules to fit startup / San Francisco tropes.</p><p>I ran a playtest last Sunday and it was a lot of fun. It felt like a Coen Brothers movie mixed with Silicon Valley - just what I was going for!</p><p>The tone has shifted throughout my iterations. I was originally aiming for a more serious and dark vibe, like Doctorow’s <i>Little Brother</i> or Stephenson’s <i>Cryptonomicon</i>. However, the rules and tropes lend themselves much more to farce / satire so I’ve veered much more in that direction. I still think there’s room for an RPG that generates Doctorow-style stories.</p><p>Anyhow - I’d any love feedback! <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AizW3DBq47rKsdw7FuUReVJbmCnk5ELLG8KNb7wt6Lw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here’s the link again</a>.</p>
