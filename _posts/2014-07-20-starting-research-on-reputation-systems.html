<p>I&rsquo;m about to embark on a comparative analysis of online reputation systems. Reputation systems (e.g. eBay seller ratings, Reddit Karma) are core to the most vibrant online communities. As more collaboration, community, and commerce move online, these systems become more important.</p>

<p>The research will likely culminate in a series of blog posts or a paper. If you know of interesting research or are would like to help - let me know!</p>
