<p>A solid last day in Japan. We woke up early and caught the Shinkansen to Osaka. After stowing our bags in a locker, we caught a local train to check out Osaka Castle. There was a nice park surrounding the castle and the fortress itself was impressive.</p>

<p>There was also a pretty impressive sand castle version:</p>

<p>We then ambled around Osaka for a couple hours before heading to the airport, where we&rsquo;re now waiting to board our flight back.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s been a wonderful trip - the people have been great, the cities all fascinating, the hikes exhausting but worthwhile, and the food has been incredible.</p>



<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have a chance to return to Japan someday soon! </p>
