<p>This afternoon, Avital and I walked around the San Francisco Botanical Garden in Golden Gate Park. It’s a huge park that is broken into sections with flora from around the world. It’s also free for SF residents.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c6a95f3d851052dfbefddd81f316e53/tumblr_inline_p0ey2nJ0J01qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>I highly recommend checking it out! I’m also tempted to write a game meant to be played in the garden.</p>
