<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/your-car-tracked-the-rapid-rise-of-license-plate-readers/">Your car, tracked: the rapid rise of license plate readers</a><br/><p>Great <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/your-car-tracked-the-rapid-rise-of-license-plate-readers/" target="_blank">article</a> by Ars Technica on the use of cameras to read license plates and track cars across communities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve previously mentioned the impact of networks of cameras covering public places in my post on <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-02-22-eagerly-anticipating-google-glasses-social.html" target="_blank">AR glasses</a> - this is just another sign of it gaining prominence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a short jump from it being used by police forces to private companies using to build profiles of potential customers for ad targeting or other, more nefarious use cases.</p>
<p>As face recognition technology improves, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see a version of the tech that tracks people, not plates.</p>
