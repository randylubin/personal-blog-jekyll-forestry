<p>I just started a new Tumblr, <a href="http://futurepressreleases.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Future Press Releases</a> which will be a collection of fictional corporate memos, marketing, and PR. I&rsquo;ll use it as a fun creative outlet and place for design fiction and probably cross-post my entries here.</p>

<p>The first post up is a <a href="http://futurepressreleases.tumblr.com/post/108366094371/gravitas-industries-enters-terrestrial-markets" target="_blank">PR announcment from Gravitas Industries</a>, maker of artificial gravity generators for space stations / ships. They&rsquo;ve recently created a smaller, cheaper version of their tech and are looking at new ways to productize it. The inspiration came from wondering why sci-fi sometimes introduces a gravity generator and then never discusses other ways it could be used.</p>

<p>Let me know if you want to contribute!</p>
