<p>This week I hit two big milestones related to game design. Our CIA Game’s Kickstarter campaign finished and I released my first game through Patreon.</p><h2>CIA: Collect It All Kickstarter</h2><p>On Tuesday, our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mmasnick/cia-collect-it-all" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> ended with $151,000 in funding – five times our goal! We were thrilled at the last minute surge of backers with brought in $40,000 in the last two days. Now we just need to produce the game. We already have a manufacturer lined up and working to get the final version of the cards ready for printing. If you missed the Kickstarter but still want a copy, you can <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/ciagame" target="_blank">pre-order here</a>.</p><h2>Honor Bound on Patreon</h2><p>Also on Tuesday, Jason Morningstar and I released Honor Bound. It’s a game that explores honor culture and masculinity through the lens of an old fashioned duel. It starts just after a challenge is issued and follows the duelists, seconds, doctor, and judge as they struggle to de-escalate a fraught situation in a society that values reputation above all else. Working with Jason was a treat and I’m proud of how the game turned out.</p><p>The game is available to anyone who backs <a href="https://www.patreon.com/randylubin" target="_blank">my Patreon</a> or <a href="https://d.rip/bullypulpitgames" target="_blank">his Drip</a>.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="992" data-orig-width="1374"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/eddf2388c16d6d776ec8ec4fe4c5c51d/tumblr_inline_p9e5kbdGBd1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="992" data-orig-width="1374"/></figure>
