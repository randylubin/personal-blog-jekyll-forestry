<p>For my birthday, today, my girlfriend planned an awesome string of activities!</p>

<p>We started out at Dynamo Donuts - the Kaffir Lime and Strawberry and Earl Grey ones were great.</p>

<p>Then we drove north to Marin. We stopped by Cowgirl Creamery, did a cheese tasting, and picked up some great prosciutto, bread, and cheeses. We brought them up to Tomales Bay Oyster Company where we picnicked by the water. Here&rsquo;s me preparing to shuck 24 oysters!</p>

<p>The food was awesome and we also had delicious honey mead wine to wash it down.</p>

<p>We then went for a short hike and took a nap by the water. Then we returned to SF in time to catch Dr. Strangelove playing at the Roxy - it was a great as I remembered.</p>

<p>Overall an awesome day - thanks Avital!</p>
