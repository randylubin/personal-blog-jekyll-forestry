<p>I was just randomly selected for <a href="http://thelistserve.com/" target="_blank">The Listserve</a> which means I&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to send a short email to a over 20,000 subscribers.</p>

<p>I want to have some fun with it so I&rsquo;ve decided to replicate Stanley Milgram&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_world_experiment" target="_blank">Small World Experiment</a>. Everyone who receives The Listserve will be instructed to start an email chain that will eventually reach me, by forwarded from friend to friend until it reaches someone who knows me.</p>

<p>Once the emails start rolling in, I&rsquo;m going to do some data analysis on how the emails got to me and what different chains looked like. My bet is that post chains will end up passing through the same one or two people as the final hop.</p>

<p>The experiment should start sometime this week and I&rsquo;ll be posting updates here on my blog.</p>
