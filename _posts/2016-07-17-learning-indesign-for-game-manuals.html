<p>I’ve started to learn Adobe InDesign so that I can make better game manuals. Until now, I’ve been making my manuals / instructions in Google Docs, which is perfect for prototypes but mediocre for polished products.</p><p>I haven’t spent much time in the Adobe suite and I also don’t have tons of visual design chops; I’m learning both the tool as well as the design judgement.</p><p>I’m starting with this InDesign tutorial series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYfCBK8IplO7YoUHtYKxavLHO-31C-Vky" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYfCBK8IplO7YoUHtYKxavLHO-31C-Vky</a></p><p>And this general visual design series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYfCBK8IplO4E2sXtdKMVpKJZRBEoMvpn" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYfCBK8IplO4E2sXtdKMVpKJZRBEoMvpn</a></p><p>I’ve heard great things about Lynda but I’m not willing to shell out cash just yet.</p><p>I’m experimenting first on the Hackers + Hustlers manual and will be posting my progress here.</p><p>Let me know if you have other great, free resources!</p>
