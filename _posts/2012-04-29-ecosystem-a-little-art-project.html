<p>I&rsquo;ve been messing around with <a href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>, a cool programming language for quickly developing dynamic digital art.</p>
<p>For my first experiment, I decided to code up an ecosystem.  You can check it out in this Java applet <a href="http://randylubin.com/ecosystem/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The green bits are algae.  The blue guys are herbivores, they eat the algae. The red guys are carnivores, they eat the blue guys.</p>
<p>Blue and red die if they don&rsquo;t eat often enough.  If they eat enough, they&rsquo;ll reproduce (split in two).  If a creature dies, it decomposes into algae.</p>
<p>You can click to place additional blue guys.</p>
<p>I had a fun time coding it up.  If I return to it, I might enable evolution (randomized, inheritable traits) and make it look a bit nicer.</p>
