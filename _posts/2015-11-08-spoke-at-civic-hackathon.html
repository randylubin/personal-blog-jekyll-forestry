<p>This weekend I gave a talk at the Civic Hackathon in SF. The event was run by <a href="http://www.generationcitizen.org/" target="_blank">Generation Citizen</a> and had middleschoolers and highschoolers working on civic engagement projects and participating in workshops.</p>

<p>My talk was ‘Learn to Code!’ and provided an overview of:</p>

<ul><li>Why coding is awesome</li>
<li>How to get started</li>
<li>What projects to choose as you learn</li>
<li>Where to go from there</li>
</ul><p>I had 15-20 students present and by the end they seemed pretty excited to start. Many already had ideas for their first projects. I really enjoyed giving the talk and I hope I inspired the kids to start a life long journey in coding!</p>
