<p>I’ve been lax about blogging the last few months so this post will cover the year’s highlights plus what I’ve been up to the last few months.</p><h2>Big Life Stuff</h2><p>Avital and I got <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2016-08-27-engaged-to-avital.html" target="_blank">engaged</a> in August! Easily the highlight of the year :)</p><figure data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="667" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/2601535f878e526789e0361dd309ae61/tumblr_inline_oj6iy2fvi81qc3e3u_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="667"/></figure><p>We moved in together in October and our perpetual sleepover is a lot of fun! We’re living in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco where we’re renting a house that is perfect for hosting!</p><h2>Work</h2><p>I started 2016 as an Entrepreneur in Residence at FactoryX - where we were trying to create a new startup every 10 weeks. It was a fun adventure, but ultimately the approach had existential flaws. By February, the writing was on the wall and my friend Nick Pinkston had been asking me to help with <a href="https://www.plethora.com/" target="_blank">Plethora</a>, his manufacturing startup.</p><p>I began consulting for Plethora in February and started their initial marketing activities: Email, Blog, Social, SEO, SEM, etc. There was plenty of work to do, I loved working with Nick and the team, and I was (and am) a huge fan of their long term vision.</p><figure data-orig-width="413" data-orig-height="44" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/c225aeb95a40609ee51787b1b60ebc68/tumblr_inline_oj6m6yfHf31qc3e3u_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="413" data-orig-height="44"/></figure><p>In May, I <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2016-06-05-officially-joining-plethora.html" target="_blank">joined full time</a> with the short term focus on marketing and sales and long term working on the biggest opportunities and challenges the company faces. Over the summer, Nick and I built the initial sales team and brought in a great Sales Director to run it. By the fall I became Interim Head of Marketing and was managing initiatives across many marketing channels with a nice sized team.</p><p>Our search for a seasoned Head of Marketing took a little longer than we expected but we hired one in December. I’m excited to onboard her and shift my focus to another big opportunity / challenge at Plethora later this winter.</p><h2>Travel</h2><p>I was lucky to get in some great travel in 2016!</p><figure data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="375" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba3dc16df0854b10369eba5665ee4f6c/tumblr_inline_oj6lp5teDt1qc3e3u_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="375"/></figure><p>I rang in the New Year in Sri Lanka (<a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2016-01-02-sri-lanka-part-one-colombo-kandy-sigiriya.html" target="_blank">Part One</a>, <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2016-01-04-sri-lanka-part-2-ella-uda-walawe-galle.html" target="_blank">Part Two</a>) and spent some of January in Bangalore helping to <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2016-01-14-bangalore-and-pngrowth.html" target="_blank">run a big startup academy</a>. It was a great trip and I hope to get back to that part of the world soon!</p><p>Avital was busy opening up <a href="http://avitaltours.com/los-angeles/" target="_blank">Avital Tours Los Angeles</a> (her second city!) and I flew down to visit her about once a month throughout the spring. I’m not interested in living in LA but there is some phenomenal food there!</p><p>In 2016, I finally got to <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2016-09-11-first-time-in-yosemite.html" target="_blank">visit Yosemite</a> and it definitely lived up to the hype! I hope to get back there before too long&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="333" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/ad47c454599f9d641ded5791c70e986f/tumblr_inline_oj6lwuP22K1qc3e3u_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="333"/></figure><p>I also made it down to Carmel for thanksgiving and got to take some great photos:</p><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b81c14d3f9403bb1f61c75a2d42ce64/tumblr_inline_oj6m0gAJw71qc3e3u_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c741f15c639029f8745019e408be8bf/tumblr_inline_oj6m14Uhqq1qc3e3u_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768"/></figure><h2>Projects / Game Making</h2><p>2016 was also incredibly productive when it came to projects and hobbies.</p><p>In April I launched my game design studio <a href="https://diegeticgames.com/" target="_blank">Diegetic Games</a>. Over the course of the year I released five games and six playable drafts – check out the <a href="https://diegeticgames.com/blog/2017/01/02/2016-Recap.html" target="_blank">Diegetic Games blog</a> for the full recap. My favorite game was probably <a href="https://diegeticgames.com/hackers_and_hustlers_rpg/" target="_blank">Hackers and Hustlers</a> - a Silicon Valley farce.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="695" data-orig-width="1640"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe36caedab3ea4b57c9848f4c295e456/tumblr_inline_oj6mgvatwx1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="695" data-orig-width="1640"/></figure><p>In 2016, I finally attended Metatopia – the best annual conference for game designers. I met so many phenomenal game designers and they were all incredibly warm, inclusive, and thoughtful. I’m looking forward to returning in 2017 and attending more conferences / conventions in general.</p><p>Outside of game design, I got to work on a few fun art projects. Most recently, I used the Plethora manufacturing system to make a <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2016-12-31-making-an-aluminum-hanukkah-menorah.html" target="_blank">Hanukkah Menorah</a>.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="500"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/08482e9b7b9bf68b95351b483e928d79/tumblr_inline_oj6mm45I4b1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="500"/></figure><p>Avital and I also started an annual tradition of making visual art for our house. We used p5js to procedurally generate a triptych which is now hanging in our living room. I’m going to write up a longer post on that process soon.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fceaa4d2067261c9542b273f0154fe5/tumblr_inline_oj6mv46rRQ1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><h2>Game Playing</h2><p>To nobody’s surprise, playing games remains one of my biggest hobbies. I got to try a ton of new games this year and my love of storytelling games has only grown.</p><p><b>RPG Campaigns</b></p><p>I ran my first <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2016-05-21-reflections-on-gming-my-first-major-rpg-campaign.html" target="_blank">extended RPG campaign</a> last spring. It had a rotating group of 14 friends and used the Dungeons and Dragons system. We had a ridiculously good time but D&amp;D was a bit too heavy for our tastes.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e6d0f108d19d1355348bf144a529124/tumblr_inline_oj6ncrGqzw1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>Last month I started a new campaign with an even larger group. We’re using a new system called Blades in the Dark and I’m sure I’ll be posting more about it this year.</p><p><b>Larp</b></p><p>2016 was the year <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2016-06-19-playing-juggernaut-and-the-tribunal.html" target="_blank">I finally tried larp</a> (live action role playing). The parlor larp genre, in particular, is an awesome fusion of theater, improv, game playing, and empathy generator. I got to try a few more larps throughout the year and some of my favorites were:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.vermillion.games/mermaid/" target="_blank">Mermaid</a> by J Li (still in development)<br/></li><li>The Line by Jason Morningstar (still in development)<br/></li><li><a href="https://payhip.com/b/uChF" target="_blank">Better Living Through Robotics</a> by Kathleen De Smet and Eva Schiffer<br/></li></ul><p>I’m definitely going to keep exploring larp in 2017 and maybe try writing my own.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>2016 was a great year personally and professionally. 2017 is bound to be an even bigger year because Avital and I are getting married! I’m back to blogging regularly so watch this space for all sorts of updates.</p>
