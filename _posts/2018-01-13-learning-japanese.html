<p>Avital and I have started learning Japanese! We’re aiming to live in Tokyo for a few months in 2019 and are working hard to learn the language.</p><p>Right now we’re using <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> to get the basics down. It’s a decent app that has built in lessons and quizzes. It’s fun but sometimes I wish they’d give more context and explanations into the lessons rather than just throw new words at us.</p><p>Duolingo has a companion app called Tinycards which has all the vocab on flashcards. They’re a helpful way to practice and there are also third party decks to supplement the Duolingo lessons – I used ones to learn the characters with mnemonics.</p><p>I’ve already learned the two kana alphabets / syllabaries: hiragana and katakana. Now I’m focused on picking up vocabulary, grammar, and learning Kanji. I’m using the website <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/dashboard" target="_blank">WaniKani</a> to memorize Kanji and more vocab. It starts slow but looks like it’ll be pretty effective.</p><p>I’m looking forward to getting proficient enough to learn by reading manga or watching anime but I think that’s still aways off.</p><p>If you have any suggestions or materials you highly recommend, let me know!</p><p>さよなら！</p>
