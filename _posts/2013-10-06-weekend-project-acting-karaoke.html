<p>This weekend I built a web app that allows you to act out scenes from movies over video chat. Sort of like karaoke but for acting.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3e1da7e3aa370a3b7b3c37e188ba8fc/tumblr_inline_muac9lJ8t71qc3e3u.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The current version is very light on the functionality and includes only two partial scenes to choose from. Possible extensions include more scenes, improv prompts, and a choose your own adventure mode.</p>

<p>This was very fun to build, though exhausting to do in one weekend. Some of the tools I used include Firebase, Angular.js, and SimpleWebRTC.</p>

<p>Because of WebRTC, it&rsquo;s only usable in Chrome and Firefox, and not on mobile.</p>

<p><em>The app is down indefinitely&hellip;</em></p>
