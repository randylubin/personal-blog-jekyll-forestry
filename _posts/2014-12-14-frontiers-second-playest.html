<p>Today I conducted the second playtest for Frontiers, the storytelling game I <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-11-30-frontiers-my-next-storytelling-game.html" target="_blank">recently mentioned</a>.</p>

<p>In this iteration, I added a special, initial adventure phase which focuses on establishing how the crew came to join up and exploring the initial world they&rsquo;re leaving. In practice, this led to us having a better grasp of the character motivations and the internal logic of the world they inhabit.</p>

<p>My biggest change with this iteration was shortening the adventure phase to generating a few key points rather than telling a 5 - 10 minute story. The steps are now:</p>

<ol><li>What is the inciting incident?</li>
<li>What is the Resolution?</li>
<li>How does this affect the characters and the worlds?</li>
</ol><p>The first two are written on the adventure card and the third point is answered by altering other cards on the table. For example, adding a key item gained onto the crew card or adding a newly established character trait to that card.</p>

<p>I like the streamlined and better structured form of this setup but we found one major drawback. We spent a good bit of time building up this new location but the time (in real-time minutes) spent in it was too short. We weren&rsquo;t ready to leave. Ultimately, the solution can be extending the adventure phase or just making it easier to have multiple adventures in each location. This is definitely something I&rsquo;ll test in the next iteration.</p>
