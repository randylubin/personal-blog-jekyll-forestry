<p>Last Sunday, Avital organized a group outing to <a href="http://www.goldengatefields.com/" target="_blank">Golden Gate Fields</a>. I hadn’t been to a horse track in years, but it was a great day!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/390ad37a4769010345c0465f46cbc12e/tumblr_inline_npz2c9s0vT1qc3e3u_540.jpg" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"/></figure><p>We were there for Dollar Day which meant entry, food, and beer was just $1.00. It was a gorgeous day and felt great to be outside. It was easy to get to the track as there was a free shuttle from the North Berkeley BART stop.</p><p>I placed a bunch of tiny bets and ended up winning most races. Overall I did the best from our group and ended up down only 80 cents&hellip;</p><p>I don’t think there are any more Dollar Days this summer but I recommend checking out the track if you’re interested in something fun and bit different this summer!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/e04ce643aea2ee38a5d548a30a3cd380/tumblr_inline_npz2gvD0LZ1qc3e3u_540.jpg" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"/></figure>
