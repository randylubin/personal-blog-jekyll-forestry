<p>There are two recent fictional TV shows that feature the tech scene in the Bay Area: HBO&rsquo;s <em>Silicon Valley</em> and Amazon&rsquo;s <em>Betas</em>. As I watch this show, I&rsquo;m sensitive to how well they capture what it&rsquo;s like to capture the bizarre, unique culture that is the startup scene in SF.</p>

<h3>Silicon Valley</h3>

<p>I just finished Silicon Valley&rsquo;s third episode. So far it&rsquo;s been funny, but not amazing. Some of the characters seem familiar but only caricatures of people I know.</p>

<p>The laughs are big but inconsistent. The first episode picked the right things to make fun of but the jokes were over the top (which is fine if you&rsquo;re appealing to a wider audience but I&rsquo;d have appreciated more subtlety). The second episode, however, had way more inside jokes (e.g. a BD guy talking about how VC&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t do DCF analysis); it got laughs from the startup kids in the room with me but less so from the non-techies.</p>

<p>Tonight&rsquo;s episode swung back to the mainstream - it didn&rsquo;t feel like it captured much of the real Silicon Valley, with the exception of the name brainstorm (It&rsquo;s really, really hard!). It seems like the show is still struggling to find it&rsquo;s voice. There&rsquo;s a lot of humorous insanity in the real silicon valley - I think the show can go far by holding to a mirror up to our biggest dysfunctions and absurdities.</p>

<h3>Betas</h3>

<p>I ignored Betas when it first launched (this past November), thinking it was Big Bang Theory set in SF; I was very wrong. I burned through the eleven episode season this week and am glad I did.</p>

<p>Like Silicon Valley, Betas tracks a small startup team through their early ups and downs. Betas has fewer laughs but feels way more authentic. The writers clearly did their research. The details are perfect; the places they hang out, the jargon and apps they use, the business decision they face are all spot on. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the characters (I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be friends with them) but, for the most part, they feel very true.</p>

<p>Overall the show closely captures what it&rsquo;s like to be in SF and striving to build a startup. The main characters can be annoying sometimes but it was worth putting up with them to see the tech scene portrayed so well. I hope they get a second season, I&rsquo;m curious to see where they go.</p>
