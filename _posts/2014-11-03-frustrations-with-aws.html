<p>Today my AWS server randomly stopped working because the server it was  virtualized on died. It was a pain to fix and I was lucky to have a backup.</p>

<p>For my most recent projects I&rsquo;ve been hosting on GitHub Pages and storing data on Firebase. I only used AWS for legacy projects and to coordinate WebRTC video for my Karaoke app.</p>

<p>Switching away from AWS is looking increasingly attractive. Other options include <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>, <a href="https://www.terminal.com/" target="_blank">Terminal</a>, and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>. Anyone have great experiences with them?</p>
