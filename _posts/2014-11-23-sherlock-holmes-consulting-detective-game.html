<p>This past week I played through most of the cases of the classic board game <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a cooperative game from the 1980&rsquo;s in which you play the role of detective. The original game consists of ten cases. Each case starts with a one - three page story laying out the mystery. Then you can turn to a map of London, a three page newspaper for that day, or flip through the address directory for all of London. You choose where you want to visit and then flip through a clue book to see what happens when you reach that place. You keep exploring until you&rsquo;re ready to solve the case, then you compare how you did to how Sherlock solved it.</p>

<p>The game is amazing. It&rsquo;s incredibly fun to chat about the clues and formulate a plan. The cases are all interesting and feature quirky characters. The game is hard though, and I&rsquo;ve gotten many of the cases wrong or only partially right, though that doesn&rsquo;t diminish the fun.</p>

<p>The game is currently sold out most places and over $100 on Amazon but there is a reprint in the works and should soon be available for about $30. I highly recommend it!</p>
