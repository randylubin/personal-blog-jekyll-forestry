<p><em>no spoilers</em></p>

<p>This weekend I marathoned House of Cards, Netflix&rsquo;s new series about power and politics in DC. I enjoyed the show (especially all the wheeling and dealing) but grew to hate all the characters by the end of the season.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t talk much more about the show (no spoilers) but I really liked the format. Netflix released the thirteen episodes all at once. The season were definitely crafted for binge consumption - highly serialized with episodes often continuing seconds after the previous one ended. I tend to consume most of my TV in marathon sessions and I appreciated being able to watch it all in quick succession.</p>

<p>Fast Company had an interesting an interesting <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671804/is-netflix-s-house-of-cards-anti-social-television" target="_blank">article</a> in which they call the format anti-social because it&rsquo;s really hard to talk about it with friends who may each be at different parts of the series. This doesn&rsquo;t happen as much with a show that&rsquo;s strung out across many weeks; there&rsquo;s more time to catch up. See more commentary on that at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/arts/television/netflixs-house-of-cards-redefines-the-spoiler-alert.html?src=twr&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">NYTimes</a>. I definitely feel that, as I&rsquo;m the first of my friends to finish&hellip;</p>

<p>Despite the spoiler difficulties, I really like the format. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how it impacts Netflix subscriptions. My guess is that they&rsquo;ll see a nice spike in sign-ups followed by higher then usual churn. If they can keep a regular flow of great, original content, they&rsquo;ll probably win over many loyal users. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if that leads them to even shorter seasons with more frequent releases. This could look like eight episode seasons / miniseries released every four months.</p>
