<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past several months in various stages of FunEmployment.  Any given week will be a mixture of consulting, learning more programming, and exploring SF.  It&rsquo;s been terrific so far but every week is a battle to stay highly productive.</p>
<p>Daily stand-ups are one way I&rsquo;ve been able to maintain focus and momentum.  The concept of a stand-up is very popular amongst bay area startups.  A team will typically meet every morning and each member will discuss what they accomplished yesterday, what they aim to accomplish today, and what &ldquo;blockers&rdquo; exist that may limit their productivity.</p>
<p>For the past few months, my friend <a href="http://chrismaury.com/" target="_blank">Chris Maury</a> has been similarly FunEmployed and we&rsquo;ve adapted the stand-up technique.  We&rsquo;ll go through the method described above twice daily: when we start working in the morning and after lunch.  It has been incredibly effective.</p>
<p>The technique has worked well for two main reasons.  First, it forces us to articulate specific, actionable goals/tasks; these keep us focused throughout the day.  Second, it introduces an an element of peer-pressure; we tend to hold ourselves to a higher standard when we know the other will be observing our progress.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only been using the technique for a few weeks but I highly recommend it.  Let me know if you have another method you recommend or if you&rsquo;d like to join us.</p>
