<p>I’ve launched my new podcast and you can find it at <a href="http://www.jammingongames.com/" target="_blank">JammingOnGames.com</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="400" data-orig-width="400"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/c5aa5aba2fb18065b311c900198f923d/tumblr_inline_oxjdim7LYn1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="400" data-orig-width="400"/></figure><p>The <a href="http://www.jammingongames.com/e/3586a37579ad9a/" target="_blank">first episode</a> has me workshopping my design for the Golden Cobra competition. I had on Nick Punt as a guest and we brainstormed ways to improve the design. It was super helpful and I’m happy with the final design. The game is called Among the Mortals and you can <a href="https://diegeticgames.com/game_files/Among-the-Mortals.pdf" target="_blank">check out the pdf</a>.</p><p>I’m hoping to record a few more episodes this month and release a new one every 2-4 weeks. Should be fun!</p>
