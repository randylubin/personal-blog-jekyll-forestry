<p>I’ve just left <a href="https://www.plethora.com/" target="_blank">Plethora</a> after a great 15 months with the company. I’ll miss the team but I’m excited to watch them continue to grow and succeed at their mission. </p><h2>My Time at Plethora</h2><p>

During my time there, I played a generalist role, tackling the biggest problems / opportunities the company faced.

<br/></p><p>As Interim Head of Marketing, I wrote and executed the marketing strategy and built a team of  7 employees and contractors working across myriad channels..  I started growth efforts in SEO, SEM, Email Campaigns, Blog Content, Social Media, Events, and PR, and also managed our website redesign.<br/><br/>As a member of the leadership team, I helped guide company strategy and culture; I interviewed key hires and advised on crucial company decisions. I also worked closely with Nick (the CEO) to hire and train the initial sales team.<br/></p><p>Since I started, we more than doubled the company size and hired many key leaders and managers. With the white space disappearing, Nick and I have struggled to find the next project for me. Ultimately it made sense for me to leave.</p><h2>What’s Next?</h2><p>I’m going to take my time, looking for startups to join and exploring my own ideas. I love playing the generalist at an early stage company and would gladly do it again. I’m also happy doing some advising / consulting and helping teams that aren’t ready for a full time business hire.</p><p>Beyond startups, I’ll be busy designing more games you can follow the updates at my studio <a href="https://diegeticgames.com/" target="_blank">Diegetic Games</a>.</p><p>Avital and I are getting married at the end of the summer and planning is sure to take up some time.</p><p>I’m also hoping to pick up some new skills. Drawing, digital audio, and fiction writing are all current candidates. I’ll update any progress here on the blog.</p>
