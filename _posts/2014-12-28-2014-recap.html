<p>It&rsquo;s been another great year! In this post, I&rsquo;ll summarize some of my highlights.</p>

<h3>Travel</h3>

<p>This was an awesome year for (free!) travel. I went hiking in Nepal as a prelude to my stint as a lecturer at the Innovate Delhi Entrepreneurship Academy. Hiking in the Himalayas was exhilarating and I hope to return some day. India was a lot of fun, though exhausting; I&rsquo;ll definitely make it back but hopefully not in the summer!</p>

<p>My other big trip was to Taiwan / Malaysia this fall, to lecture at the MaGIC Startup Academy in Kuala Lumpur. This entire trip was a blast and I look forward to exploring more of Asia before too long.</p>

<h3>Lecturing</h3>

<p>This year I was a guest lecturer at startup bootcamps in both Delhi and Kuala Lumpur - both experiences were awesome and I enjoyed talking about start up strategy, business models, negotiations, etc. It was also fun to mentor the young entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>I also gave a few talks this year on the future of collaboration and the economy. I still need to write them up into blog posts; doing so will be one of my top priorities in the next month.</p>

<h3>Plotypus</h3>

<p>My biggest project this year was <a href="http://plotypus.com/" target="_blank">Plotypus</a>, a collaborative storytelling card game.</p>

<p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f99bd4762d4f28804948dc8d4d62d26d/tumblr_inline_nhb2e0PcUa1qc3e3u.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>It was incredibly fun and meaningful to take the game from idea to polished product, and to do a small batch manufacturing run. This has definitely been my most successful project to date. I might revisit Plotypus at some point, perhaps for a Kickstarter, but I&rsquo;m focused on other projects for now.</p>

<h3>Other Games and Game Design</h3>

<p>While Plotypus monopolized much of my game design efforts this year, I have a few other games in development - I&rsquo;ll continue posting updates on them here. Game design is shaping up to be a lifelong hobby. I&rsquo;m currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615642047/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0615642047&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=randylubincom-20&amp;linkId=6XDTXHKXBUKL22IQ" target="_blank">Play at the World</a> which provides a great history of wargaming and RPGs - I&rsquo;ll probably do a lot more thinking and writing about games in the 2015.</p>

<p>In addition to designing games, I played a ton of them. My favorite board game this year was definitely <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-11-23-sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-game.html" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective</a> though I&rsquo;ll give an honorable mention to the <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-01-26-quick-thoughts-on-eclipse.html" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> expansion, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/125898/eclipse-rise-ancients" target="_blank">Rise of the Ancients</a>. Other games that saw lots of table play included <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148951/tiny-epic-kingdoms" target="_blank">Tiny Epic Kingdoms</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter" target="_blank">Love Letter</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert" target="_blank">Space Alert</a>, and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104162/descent-journeys-dark-second-edition" target="_blank">Descent</a>. I recently <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-12-23-pen-and-paper-role-playing-games.html" target="_blank">GMed my first game</a> of the Star Wars RPG Edge of the Empire - I hope to explore RPGs a bit more in the coming year.</p>

<h3>Blogging</h3>

<p>This is my 56th post for 2014 - I don&rsquo;t think I missed a week of <a href="http://iron-blogger-sf.com/the-rules/" target="_blank">Iron Blogger</a> this year. We&rsquo;re starting fresh next week - let me know if you want to join! My favorite post from this year was the one puzzling out <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-11-06-competitive-advantage-of-cooperatives-and-daos.html" target="_blank">what roles DAOs and worker cooperatives have in the new economy</a>.</p>

<h3>Professional Work</h3>

<p>While I was technically &lsquo;funemployed&rsquo; for 2014, I still engaged in a lot of professional activity. I&rsquo;ve already discussed my lecturing on startup topics; I also advised several startups in SF and elsewhere and did a few consulting gigs.</p>

<p>I explored several of my own startup ideas but none of them survived my vetting process. I also received a few job offers but I ultimately turned them down - they didn&rsquo;t meet my criteria. I&rsquo;ll dive back into the search process early next year.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>This was an excellent year, full of great experiences and cool outputs. Nonetheless, I know I was much less productive than I could have been. Next week, I&rsquo;ll analyze this shortcoming and set goals for 2015.</p>
