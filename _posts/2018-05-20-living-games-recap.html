<p>I just wrapped up my first Living Games and it was an incredible week. I got a glimpse into some of the incredibly diverse and evolving sub-cultures that make up the broader live action community and hung out with an array of incredible designers who are exploring the limits of the medium.</p><p><a href="http://www.livinggamesconference.com/" target="_blank">Living Games</a> is a conference that explores larp and adjacent forms of play through both academic and practitioner perspectives. The conference itself was Friday - Sunday and packed with keynotes, panels, workshops, demos, and more. I’m pretty sure I generated a few new game ideas from every panel I attended. Almost all of the talks were filmed and I’m looking forward to catching up on the ones I missed once they’re posted.</p><p>The highlight was definitely the other attendees. I had a great time catching up with friends I’ve made at other conferences and I met a bunch of other great designers whom I look forward to seeing again soon.</p><p>If you are at all curious about the field, or interested in other types of embodied play, I highly recommend attending when it returns in 2020!</p>
