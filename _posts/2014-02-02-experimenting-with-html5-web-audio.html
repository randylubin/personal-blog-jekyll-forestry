<p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on HTML5&rsquo;s Web Audio API for a while now. The API allows for easy audio synthesis and manipulation in the browser without any plugins (e.g. Flash). When I first started learning about Web Audio, it wasn&rsquo;t available on Chrome - I held back on tinkering because I like easily sharing my projects. Chrome now enables the full Web Audio API.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m most excited about the ability to create oscillators (simple tones) extremely easily. You can synthesize music on demand with no need to pre-create music files for each note / tone.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a little time this weekend toying with the code and it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to get started. For a good intro to oscillators, try <a href="http://middleearmedia.com/web-audio-api-oscillators/" target="_blank">this link</a>. To see some cool all-HTML synths and other experiments, look <a href="http://stuartmemo.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope to create a few fun projects as I explore the API. Some broad areas include:</p>

<ol><li>Agent Based Models creating procedurally generated music</li>
<li>Games that incidentally create music as the players and AI interact</li>
<li>Easy new electronic instruments where it&rsquo;s impossible to hit a bad note</li>
<li>Interactive audio experiments that demonstrate key concepts of music theory</li>
</ol><p>I&rsquo;ll be posting my results here!</p>
