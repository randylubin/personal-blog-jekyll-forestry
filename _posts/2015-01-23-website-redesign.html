<p>It&rsquo;s been two years since I updated my website / blog design; I spend some time this week updating the look and unifying the blog with my main site.</p>

<p>The new look is cleaner and more orderly than the old one. The blog now looks just like the main site (though it is hosted on Tumblr). I&rsquo;m also using different pages for each section of the site, rather than a single page app.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have feedback! I&rsquo;ll probably be making minor tweaks and would love your input.</p>

<p>The other big change is behind the scenes - I switched the hosting to GitHub Pages. I still have my AWS box and use it for some side projects but it tends to occasionally break. GitHub Pages is super easy to use and highly reliable.</p>
