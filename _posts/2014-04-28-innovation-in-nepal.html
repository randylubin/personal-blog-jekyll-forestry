<p>As I mentioned earlier - <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-03-16-going-to-india.html" target="_blank">I&rsquo;m heading to India next month</a>! I&rsquo;m still solidifying my travel plans but it looks like I&rsquo;ll also be spending some time in Nepal at the end of May.</p>

<p>Whenever I travel I like to check out the local startup scene. If you know of any cool innovation happening in Kathmandu or Pokhara please let me know!</p>

<p>Otherwise the agenda is pretty up in the air - though I&rsquo;ll likely trek a little bit of the Annapurna Circuit. Feel free to send suggestions my way.</p>
