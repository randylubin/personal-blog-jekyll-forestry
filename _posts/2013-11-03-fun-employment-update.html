<p>It&rsquo;s just under two months since I left Jive and I&rsquo;ve been busy!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-09-17-failing-at-fun-employment.html" target="_blank">first few weeks</a> were incredibly busy and fun, though not as productive as I wanted. I was much more focused in October and launched two side projects - <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-10-14-side-project-jam-sync.html" target="_blank">Jam-Sync</a> and <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-10-06-weekend-project-acting-karaoke.html" target="_blank">Acting Karaoke</a>. I also visited St. Louis for my brother&rsquo;s Parents Weekend and I spent the past week moving to my new apartment. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun but I&rsquo;m increasingly ready to jump back into startup mode.</p>

<p>My goal for November is to get focused on legitimate startup ideas - not just side projects. I plan to crank out some blog posts, synthesizing the research / brainstorming I&rsquo;ve been doing, and conduct more interviews with experts / potential customers. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll zero in on an awesome problem to solve.</p>
