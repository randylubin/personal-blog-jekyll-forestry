<p>I have seen the future of education in the video game Rocksmith 2014. 
The game is like Guitar Hero / Rock Band but played with an actual guitar. It&rsquo;s incredibly fun and effective at increasing guitar skills. Everyone I&rsquo;ve had play it has been instantly hooked - several friends have bought it immediately from their phones.</p>

<p>The guitar connects via their USB cable and you can use any electric guitar to play. Notes / chords slide down the screen and you pluck / strum your guitar to hit them.</p>

<p>There are three main modes - Learn a Song, Session, and Guitarcade - and supplementary materials including a chord book and many video lessons on guitar techniques.</p>

<p>In Learn a Song mode, you learn and play through a popular song. Like Guitar Hero / Rock Band you start with just a few notes per measure but then build up to the playing every note of the song. The game comes with 50 songs; if you own the original game, you can import 50 additional songs; there is also regularly released DLC. The song selection is pretty good. I was excited by about 50% from the start, another 30% are intersting enough to try and the rest I&rsquo;ll probably never play.</p>

<p>The game adapts to your skill level on a per-section basis; you might be at full difficulty for the chorus but 37% toughness on the solo. This is great at facilitating flow state as you&rsquo;re always playing at the optimal combination of skill and difficulty. Even after every measure is at 100% you can still strive for accomplishments such as not missing a note. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered a song, the note indicators fade away and you can try to play from memory.</p>

<p>Session mode is one of my favorite parts of the game. You can select a backing band, a key, and a scale and then start improvising. The band will adjust it&rsquo;s energy and tempo to suit your style of play. It&rsquo;s incredibly fun and I can feel myself improving. I&rsquo;m looking forward to my next real life jam session and showing off what I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>

<p>Guitarcade is a collection of minigames focused on specific techniques. They&rsquo;re modeled on old school arcade games and pretty fun in their own right. For example, Star Chords is a space shooter on rails where your fire at enemies by hitting the correct chords.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had the game for a week and I&rsquo;m loving it. I consider myself an intermediate guitar player and I&rsquo;m learning a ton. I can see it being more useful for beginners. It probably has less pedagogical value for advanced players but is still a very fun way to learn songs. The only feature missing is the ability to use modern staff notation (sheet music) - I&rsquo;d like to start learning the actual notes I&rsquo;m playing in addition to &lsquo;fret 7, string 3&rsquo; - otherwise the game is near flawless.</p>

<h2>Purchasing the Game</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going to buy the game, you&rsquo;ll need the USB cable and the software. If you want the 50 extra songs from the original Rocksmith, you need to buy that version as well as a $10 upgrade DLC.</p>

<p>I recommend buying the original game on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S5TDUQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004S5TDUQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=randylubincom-20%22" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. It&rsquo;s $30 and includes the cable. You can then buy Rocksmith 2014 on Steam without the cable along with the extra track DLC. This comes to $100 total for 100 songs and the cable. The other option is paying $80 for just Rocksmith 2014 and the cable. I think the extra $20 is well worth it for the original version&rsquo;s songs.</p>
