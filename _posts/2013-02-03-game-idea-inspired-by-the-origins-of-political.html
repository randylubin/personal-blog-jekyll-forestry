<p>I&rsquo;m considering making a game in which, as the player, you make certain, narrow choices about the structure of a civilization and then observe political order emerging or decaying.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reading Francis Fukuyama&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Political_Order" target="_blank">The Origins of Political Order</a>. Fukuyama provides a fascinating overview of how and why different political states form. It&rsquo;s incredibly interesting to see how groups with similar starting conditions can end up with radically different outcomes in terms of rule of law, equality, and accountability.</p>

<p>I think it would be really interesting to create a game / simulation in which you guide a civilization through various stages of development and watch as the state evolves. You would probably only be able to make decisions at key tipping points in the civilization&rsquo;s history, the rest of game would be emergent from the starting conditions and chance events.</p>

<p><em>Sample decision: you need to build a great irrigation project to support the growing population, do you raise taxes from the peasants or aristocracy?</em></p>

<p>Some of the key factors to your civilization&rsquo;s statehood would be:</p>

<ul><li>Geography</li>
<li>Relative Power of Neighboring States</li>
<li>Role of Religion</li>
<li>Rule of Law</li>
<li>Political Accountability</li>
<li>Distribution of Wealth</li>
<li>Culture</li>
<li>Power distribution among state leader, aristocracy, bourgiouse, and peasants / working class</li>
</ul><p>These factors would change based on your decisions, but not always in an immediately intuitive fashion. Beyond your decisions, there would likely be random events such as:</p>

<ul><li>The spread of innovation, religion, and culture from adjacent lands</li>
<li>Disasters (plague, famine, barbarian attacks)</li>
<li>Political intrigue (assassinations, unification of kingdoms through marriage)</li>
</ul><p>The game would run as a simulation (maybe an agent based model) in between events and decisions. There probably wouldn&rsquo;t be any way to <em>win</em> though players could set their own goals:</p>

<ul><li>Lasting as long as possible</li>
<li>Amassing the largest empire</li>
<li>Maximizing equality</li>
</ul><p>The civilizations would morph over the course of the game through different levels of complexity:</p>

<ul><li>Hunter-gather bands</li>
<li>Tribes</li>
<li>Warlord controlled districts</li>
<li>Kingdoms</li>
<li>Empires</li>
<li>Nation-states</li>
</ul><p>If your civilization collapses, you may have the option to take control of one of the emergent states that come out of the chaos.</p>

<p>The game would probably have some overlap with and take inspiration from:</p>

<ul><li>Sim City</li>
<li>Civilization</li>
<li>NationStates.net</li>
<li>Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life</li>
</ul><p>It would also likely take on many elements from roguelikes:</p>

<ul><li>Randomly generated terrain, neighbors</li>
<li>Death / losing is common</li>
<li>No saving</li>
</ul><p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m just starting to noodle on the idea&hellip; if I still like it by next weekend, I may through together a prototype.</p>

<p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>
