<p>It&rsquo;s been a crazy few days.</p>

<p>The Ungrounded flight was fun but exhausting. Everyone on the flight was incredible - brilliant, accomplished, and really nice. It was a bit tough doing a hackathon in flight but IDEO did a good job facilitating. You can see a full writeup of the flight by Chrissy: <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/14/brainstorming-at-30k-feet-reflections-from-the-hackathon-in-the-sky/" target="_blank">http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/14/brainstorming-at-30k-feet-reflections-from-the-hackathon-in-the-sky/</a></p>

<p>After arriving at the hotel we had some free time. I grabbed a pint with some friends and then walked through Regent&rsquo;s Park - an old favorite from when I lived in London. At 6pm we went over to the House of Lords where Baroness Scotland of Asthal greeted us; she was a great host and treated us to a tour of Parliament and a great cocktail reception.</p>

<p>We were still hungry around 11pm so a few of us went on an adventure around SOHO to find some food - we ended up grabbing some delicious dishes in Chinatown.</p>

<p>Today we had back to back summits. First was a G8 Innovation Conference with some nice TED style talks. The morning was capped off with an appearance by Prime Minister David Cameron. It was great to see him in such a small venue and he gave a nice speech on Britain&rsquo;s efforts to foster innovation.</p>

<p>The afternoon switched to the DNA Summit and we got to hear from several of our fellow Ungrounded participants - also lots of fun. We were then brought to a gala at the Royal Academy of Arts - a great way to finish the official segment of the trip.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re on our own now - I&rsquo;m spending the next few days catching up with friends in London before spending a couple days in Edinburgh mid-week. I&rsquo;ll then return to London for another few days before heading out on the 23rd.</p>

<p>Great start to what I&rsquo;m sure will be an awesome trip!</p>
