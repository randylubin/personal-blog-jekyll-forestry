<p>Earlier today, three friends and I spent an hour sprinting around Chinatown as part of <a href="http://citydash.fire-hazard.net/" target="_blank">Citydash</a>, an outdoor game. The game involved running around a 15 square block area, following clues and dodging (in-game) guards.</p>

<p>We were racing the clock as well as other teams - there were bonuses for being the first team to reach a checkpoint. There were points if we got close to a guard without the guard seeing us.</p>

<p>The game had a nice app component where we submitted the codes which confirmed we reached the checkpoint; it also provided hints and displayed a leaderboard.</p>

<p>My team won! And by a nice margin too&hellip;</p>

<p>Some of the best moments involve hiding behind cars and in shops and then sprinting away from guards.</p>

<p>Today was the playtest for the full event this Saturday. I highly recommend you check it out!
