<p>Following on <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2014-07-13-rogue-like-card-game.html" target="_blank">this post</a></p>

<p>I came up with a quick set of rules to start testing my card game rouge-like via Munchkins. I filtered the monsters treasures into four &lsquo;levels&rsquo; of the dungeon and added a health and revised combat system.</p>

<p>I play-tested with my brother and we found that the hero scales much too fast and later monsters don&rsquo;t pose a challenge. Further, we found there was a clearly dominant strategy which doesn&rsquo;t lead to fun gameplay.</p>

<p>For the next test, I&rsquo;m going to play with the combat system some more and try to add some time pressure for single player (e.g. a countdown timer before the dungeon collapses).</p>
