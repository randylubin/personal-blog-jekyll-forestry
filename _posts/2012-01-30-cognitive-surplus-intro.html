<p>I love talking about cognitive surplus&hellip;   Clay Shirky coined the term in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143119583/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=randylubincom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0143119583" target="_blank">Cognitive Surplus: How Technology Makes Consumers into Collaborators</a><img border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=randylubincom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0143119583" width="1"/>.  I&rsquo;ll provide a brief overview of the concept in this post and then elaborate on possibilites in follow-ups.</p>
<p>First, an awesome fact from the book:</p>
<p>The cumulative amount of volunteer time that has gone into creating the English version of Wikipedia (authoring, editing, discussing content): 100 million hours.</p>
<p>The total amount of TV commercials watched by Americans every weekend: 100 million hours.  Every weekend!</p>
<p>We, as a society, have a tremendous amount of free time.  Shirky calls this cognitive surlus and it represents a tremendous asset for us to harness&hellip; or let waste.  The internet provides new opportunities for individuals to spend their time creating and collaborating but for every Wikipedia editor or <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> contributor, there are many more people posting pictures of cats with captions or harvesting virtual crops.  There is an immense potential to leverage our society&rsquo;s cognitive surplus to have a positive impact on the world&hellip; we need to start creating fun, engaging opportunities for participation.</p>
