<p>Tonight, Avital and I got to check out the <a href="http://www.magiccastle.com/" target="_blank">Magic Castle</a> in LA and it was a great time! We got to see four shows, covering stage magic, close-up, mentalism, and more. The building itself is a maze filled with magicians’ artifacts from throughout the years and it was fun to wander and take it all in. I highly recommend visiting if you have a chance, but you’ll need an invite from a member – if you have any magician friends you should ask them!</p>
