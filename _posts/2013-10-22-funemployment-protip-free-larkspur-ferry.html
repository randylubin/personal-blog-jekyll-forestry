<p>Today I took advantage of the excellent, free <a href="http://goldengate.org/MCMPromo/index.php" target="_blank">Larkspur Ferry Deal</a>. The ferries are almost empty for reverse commutes so Golden Gate Ferry is allowing free trips to Larkspur in the morning and back in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Larkspur is a town in Marin County, north of SF. In order to get the free return ticket, you need to make a purchase at a local vendor.</p>

<p>Midmorning, I left from the SF Ferry Building when it was foggy and cold. As we sailed north, the sky cleared; Larkspur was warm and sunny.</p>

<p>Across from the Larkspur ferry building is the Marin County Mart - a cute outdoor mall with several restaurants, clothing stores, and a Starbucks. There is tons of outdoor seating and easy wifi.</p>

<p>After a quick lunch, I snagged a shady picnic table, broke out my laptop and coded for several hours. It was great to work outside and I was pretty productive.</p>

<p>Satisfied with my progress, I walked back to the Larkspur Ferry. By now, most of the fog burned off and there were great views of the bay.</p>

<p>It was a perfect break from working in SF and I&rsquo;ll definitely be going again. The current deal lasts until November but I bet they&rsquo;ll bring it back (they tested it out in August, too).</p>
