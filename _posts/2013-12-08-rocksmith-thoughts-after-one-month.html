<p>I&rsquo;ve now had Rocksmith for over a month and want to follow up. I first wrote a review here: <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-11-10-review-rocksmith-2014.html" target="_blank">http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-11-10-review-rocksmith-2014.html</a></p>

<p>After five weeks and maybe 60 hours of play, my esteem of Rocksmith completely holds up! I&rsquo;ve definitely been improving. I started as an intermediate guitarist and now feel intermediate / advanced. Further, I feel much more confident jamming with others. Session mode is great for practicing improvisation, though I wish it would walk me through different chord progressions.</p>

<p>The game has three different paths for each song - lead guitar (riffs, solo), rhythm guitar (mostly chords) and bass guitar. This weekend I bought a bass - something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to try for a while - and it works extremely well with the game; I&rsquo;m definitely going to learn bass much faster because of Rocksmith.</p>

<p>Now that I have two instruments, we&rsquo;ve been messing with multiplayer. Split screen works very well and it&rsquo;s a blast to play with someone else. I&rsquo;ll probably buy a second chord so multiplayer is always an option.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been purchasing a bit of DLC (extra songs). Steam autumn sale had all songs at 50% off. There&rsquo;s already a ton of songs on there from the first game and Ubisoft is releasing new songs every Tuesday. I&rsquo;ve already purchased Rush, Radiohead, and Allman Brothers packs - so great!</p>

<p>In summary - I stand by my first impressions; Rocksmith is a tremendous game that can make anyone, of any skill, a better guitarist or bass player. It&rsquo;s brought me from playing guitar a few hours a month for about an hour per day and I don&rsquo;t see that changing anytime soon!</p>
