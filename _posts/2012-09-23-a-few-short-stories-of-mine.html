<p>In lieu of a new post this week, I&rsquo;ve dredged up some old short stories I wrote. This is the first time I&rsquo;m posting them on the web. I wrote them for a Fiction Writing course I took Senior year at Wash U.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://randylubin.com/fiction/time-sickness.pdf" target="_blank">Time-Sickness</a></li>
<li><a href="http://randylubin.com/fiction/acapulco.pdf" target="_blank">The Vampire of Acapulco</a></li>
<li><a href="http://randylubin.com/fiction/alchemy.pdf" target="_blank">Alchemy</a></li>
</ul><p>I just read them myself for the first time in almost three years. It&rsquo;s interesting to see which themes still resonate with me today. My favorite of these three is <em>Time-Sickness</em>. It&rsquo;s pretty a pretty odd assortment of scenes and ramblings on the nature of time. I think it capture the unease I felt at the pace time was passing back then. I still feel a little time-sickness every so often&hellip;</p>
<p>The other two stories are a bit goofier. <em>Acapulco</em> was in response to a constrained writing assignment and my buddy Brad found the story very amusing. <em>Alchmey</em> was a throwback to the choose your own adventure genre in which I attempted a bit of satire; the choices had extremely odd ramifications. I don&rsquo;t think it worked as a satire or choose your own adventure but it has some interesting conceits.</p>
<p>For completeness here are a few short stories I had written around the same time. They&rsquo;ve been on my site for ages but I never posted them to this blog. I think <em>Upload</em> is the most interesting of the lot&hellip;</p>
