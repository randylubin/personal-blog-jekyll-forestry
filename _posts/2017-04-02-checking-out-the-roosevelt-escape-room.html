<p>Earlier today I went through the <a href="https://roosevelt-escape.com/" target="_blank">Roosevelt Escape Room</a> with some friends and I had a great time! It was supposed to be pretty challenging but we finished it in 72 minutes (18 minutes to spare) and many groups don’t finish at all. <br/><br/>I’ve had mixed experiences with escape room games. The ones I’ve tried in the past tend to have disparate puzzles that aren’t particularly elegant and don’t integrate into any larger narrative – I often cite escape rooms when defining Ludonarrative Dissonance. Roosevelt Escape room was a strong exception to this trend.<br/><br/>The production values were impressive – we went through a series of rooms that had thematic, interesting visuals. The puzzles were well integrated into the space and featured very cool use of electronics / physical components. The theme / story was fine enough, though I could have used a little more self-awareness around sending folks off to die in WWI.<br/><br/>I highly recommend checking it out and I’ll likely go back some time to check out the other room by the same group, <a href="https://houdini-escape.com/" target="_blank">The Great Houdini Escape Room</a>.<br/><br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1080" data-orig-height="648" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/fc9ce2f94c70df9c55f29155722fb25c/tumblr_inline_ontg8qMMmg1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-width="1080" data-orig-height="648"/></figure>
