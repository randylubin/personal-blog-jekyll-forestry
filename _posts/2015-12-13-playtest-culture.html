<p>I&rsquo;ve been running a bunch of playtests recently - for my worldbuilding game <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2015-12-06-panorama-draft.html" target="_blank">Panorama</a> and, yesterday, for a second game I’ve been developing. I’ve also gotten to play a bunch of early stage games that friends are designing.</p><p>The steady stream of playtest events has been amazing. It’s more exciting to work on a game when you know you’ll be getting feedback in just a few days. A scheduled test is the best way to force yourself to finish a new version of the rules. It’s also been great to see the other developers’ games evolve and to share feedback with each other.</p><p>If you’re interested in game design, I highly recommend getting a regular crew together to test each other’s games. I deeply appreciate the community I have and hope to keep up the pace of multiple tests per month.</p>
