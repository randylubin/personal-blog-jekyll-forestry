<p>I&rsquo;ve just signed up for <a href="https://www.23andme.com" target="_blank">23andMe</a>, the personal genomics company; I&rsquo;m very excited.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>
<ol><li>They mail me a vial for a spit sample and I send it back</li>
<li>Their lab analyzes my DNA across ~100,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)</li>
<li>I receive results in 2-3 weeks</li>
</ol><p>The results include info on my ancestry, potential disease risks as I age, carrier status for inherited diseases, and estimates for how I&rsquo;ll respond to different drugs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the quantified self movement, though I haven&rsquo;t practiced much of it myself. This will be my first serious foray into analyzing myself. I&rsquo;d love to do a full genome sequence but it&rsquo;s still too expensive. The method 23andMe uses, SNPs, still provides a lot of information and will hopefully lead to some cool insights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll definitely do an update here once I get my results and might share the results themselves - depending on how I feel about privacy.</p>
