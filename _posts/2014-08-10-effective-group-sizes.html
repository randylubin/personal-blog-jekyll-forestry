<p>I recently was in a conversation about different effective group sizes. I brought up Falkvinge&rsquo;s (founder of the Pirate Party) book / manual &lsquo;Swarmwise&rsquo; as commenting heavily on it. Here&rsquo;s a brief summary:</p>

<p>Falkvinge identifies three magic group sizes : 7, 30, 150</p>

<h3>Seven People - Effective Working Group</h3>

<p>This is a small group of deeply interdependent collaborators. The key tension is that each additional worker brings some productivity but adds N-1 new relationships which need to be maintained (the eighth member brings seven new ties to existing members). Falkvinge says the tradeoffs are unfavorable after seven members - too much time would be spent maintaining the group.</p>

<h3>Thirty People - Loose Coordination Group</h3>

<p>He refers to this size as an 'extended family&rsquo; (side note - hunter-gatherers traveled in bands of 30-50). These are groups where you know everyone&rsquo;s name plus a few other details. These groups are good for broad coordination, not deep collaboration. At more than 30 they form a bottle neck and should split in two.</p>

<h3>150 People - Tribe Size</h3>

<p>This comes from Dunbar&rsquo;s number and Falkvinge cites it as the point at which <em>informal</em> groups lose their fun and efficiency. When he sees groups approaching this limit, he creates space for sub-swarms to emerge.
Falkvinge also started with an empty global org chart with hundreds of positions and filled them as they expanded.</p>

<p>You can find the meat of group size analysis starting on page 51: <a href="http://falkvinge.net/files/2013/04/Swarmwise-2013-by-Rick-Falkvinge-v1.1-2013Sep01.pdf" target="_blank">http://falkvinge.net/files/2013/04/Swarmwise-2013-by-Rick-Falkvinge-v1.1-2013Sep01.pdf</a></p>

<p>The entire book is worth a read and is part memoir / part how-to manual. It&rsquo;s a fascinating look at building decentralized organizations that maintain strong leadership. It pairs well with Graeber&rsquo;s 'The Democracy Project&rsquo; which chronicles the birth of OWS, a leaderless organization. Not surprising that the org with leaders was much more successful.</p>
