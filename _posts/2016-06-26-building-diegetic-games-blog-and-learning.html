<p>I’ve been working on the site for my game studio <a href="http://diegeticgames.com" target="_blank">Diegetic Games</a> and made some major progress this weekend.</p><p>I’m hosting the site on github pages and I’m now using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> which makes content management super easy. Jekyll lets me use templates for different page types and includes for the head, header, and footer. It auto assembles a main blog page and I can write my posts in markdown. It was really easy to get Jekyll set up.</p><p>I’m going to start shifting some of my game writing and announcements over to the Diegetic Games blog which you can find at: <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/blog/" target="_blank">Diegetic Games Blog</a></p><p>I’m also going to start adding learning resources for folks getting into story games and game design. The first page is up here: <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/learn/" target="_blank">Learn about Story Games</a> - it’s an intro to storytelling games, RPGs and LARPs.</p>
