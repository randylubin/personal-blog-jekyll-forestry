<p>I was going to write out a short story for this week but ran out of time. Instead I&rsquo;ll provide a quick overview of where it might have gone&hellip;</p>
<p>Premise: it would explore the impact of the tooth fairy injecting money into the economy by leaving it under pillows.</p>
<div>
<ul><li>In enough quantity, this may cause inflation</li>
<li>The end of high inflation toward the end of the &lsquo;70s (80&rsquo;s?) was due to increased fluoride in the water</li>
<li>Hyperinflation such as in South American nations or the Weimar Republic were due to the introduction of new candy bars into those regions</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve coordinates with the tooth fairy / dental associations to adjust money supply</li>
<li>The tooth fairy is the best way out of any recession - giving more money to kids who lose teeth does a great job of stimulating demand</li>
</ul><p>That&rsquo;s all I have for now&hellip; I might revisit it later if I have the time or inclination</p>
