<p>I just broke out my game <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/game_files/The_Idealist.pdf" target="_blank">The Idealist</a> into its own downloadable file and gave <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/condemned/" target="_blank">Condemned</a> its own page on <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/" target="_blank">Diegetic Games</a>.</p><p>I actually didn’t get to playtest The Idealist until <b>after</b> the competition but it played exactly as I hoped. We created interesting progressive characters in a fantasy city where the elvish elite were sapping the residents energy. The characters started out as reformers but slowly sacrificed all of their values in the quest for power - just the arc I wanted!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="813" data-orig-width="1054"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/979542f3f8c6a3e37cf2616431997b51/tumblr_inline_obxfg0pGY01qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="813" data-orig-width="1054"/></figure>
