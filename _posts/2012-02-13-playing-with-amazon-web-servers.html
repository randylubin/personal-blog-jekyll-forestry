<p>An important part of teaching myself to code has been learning the LAMP stack.  LAMP refers to Linux (operating system), Apache (web server), MySQL (database), and a coding language (I used python).  By tinkering with the entire stack, I developed a better sense of how the components fit together.</p>
<p>This past year I was fortunate enough to have free access to an awesome server, which was  a perfect sandbox.  Last week, I was forced to look for a new solution.  I found a great option in Amazon Web Servers.</p>
<p>Amazon Web Servers (AWS) has a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank">free usage tier</a> which provides a small Linux box for a year.  While there are many AWS products, I was focused on EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) on which you can have you&rsquo;re own cloud based server.  Initial sign-up was easy but then I found an intimidating array of options.  I decided to use <a href="http://www.robotmedia.net/2011/04/how-to-create-an-amazon-ec2-instance-with-apache-php-and-mysql-lamp/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to set up the LAMP stack and it was a very easy process.  Migrating all of my content from the old server to AWS was simple as well.</p>
<p>There are myriad aspects of AWS which I look forward to exploring.  If you&rsquo;re at all curious, you should sign up for the free tier and start tinkering, too.</p>
