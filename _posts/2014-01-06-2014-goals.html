<p>My last post <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2013-12-29-2013-recap.html" target="_blank">recapped 2013</a>. This post will talk a bit about my goals for 2014.</p>

<p>My primary goal is to be more productive. Borrowing from a friend&rsquo;s idea - I&rsquo;m going to start measuring the daily percentage of time spent productively and aim to keep improving that number.</p>

<p>For me, productivity can be many things - working on side projects, interviewing potential customers, volunteering, focused learning, prototyping, etc. I&rsquo;m going to break out my hours and might set sub-goals each week. I&rsquo;m not sure how I&rsquo;m going to track them but I&rsquo;ve heard good things about <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/" target="_blank">https://www.rescuetime.com/</a></p>

<p>Some other tactics I&rsquo;ll try include: scheduling coworking days with friends, putting specific appointments on my calendar for different specific productivity goals, finding collaborators for specific side projects or learning challenges.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be posting some of the successes and failures of these methods here - I&rsquo;m hoping <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorn_effect" target="_blank">Hawthorn Effect</a> alone will be able to drive a huge increase in output. We&rsquo;ll see!</p>
