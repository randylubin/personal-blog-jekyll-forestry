<p>I&rsquo;m noodling on an idea for a card game that borrows heavily from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike" target="_blank">Roguelike</a> genre.</p>

<p>The Roguelike elements that I want to dive into are fast leveling (getting very powerful very quickly), perma-death (once your character dies, there&rsquo;s no bringing them back), and randomly generated levels.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll probably start prototyping with the deck from Munchkins as it already has plenty of items and monster cards. Gameplay might involve going through increasingly challenging levels of a dungeon with harder monsters and better rewards. If your hero dies, you might be able to send a second here forward to loot the corpse.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also interested in creating a 2 (or more) player version which is set up for coopetition - the heroes can help each other out but there are strong incentives to backstab at some point - inspired by Indy vs Belloq.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post my progress here&hellip;</p>
