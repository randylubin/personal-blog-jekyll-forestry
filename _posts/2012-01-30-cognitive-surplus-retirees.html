<p>This is a follow-up to my previous post <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/2019/05/11/2012-01-30-cognitive-surplus-intro.html" title="cognitive-surplus-intro" target="_blank">Cognitive Surplus: Intro</a></p>
<p>Retirees are one group which have a remarkable amount of cognitive surplus and represent an immense untapped asset.  Many retirees while away their days watching TV and playing golf or cards.  At first this may be a nice reprieve from decades of hard work but many find it unfulfilling; they are left bored and bereft of meaningful activity.</p>
<p>When people (especially young people) think of retirees they envision infirm elders lacking in energy or intellectual vigor.  There are large numbers of retirees for whom this couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>The baby boomers are starting to retire in droves and they don&rsquo;t want to spend their remaining decades idle.  They have built up a tremendous amount of expertise throughout their careers and we as a society should seek to harness it.  Furthermore, the boomers have spent the last decade or two of their careers online.  They are not afraid of technology; we can reach them through the web and via mobile apps.</p>
<p>I hope to see an explosion of startups seeking to engage with these recent retirees.  Leveraging their cognitive surplus will result in a tremendous creation of value and meaning.</p>
<p>In a future post I&rsquo;ll speculate on why types of products might make the most sense.</p>
