<p>My podcast host recently switched from free to paid (and not cheap either) so I decided to switch to free, self hosting. You can check out the new site at <a href="https://jammingongames.com/" target="_blank">JammingOnGames.com</a></p><p>After poking around, I decided to use <a href="https://jekyll-octopod.github.io" target="_blank">Octopod</a> which is a Jekyll extension. I already use Jekyll for my other websites and it was pretty to get up to speed on Octopod. My new setup allows me to host my site and all of the audio files on GitHub and I have a script which automatically updates the RSS feed and deploys the code to GitHub pages – 100% free! I’m also using <a href="http://analytics.podtrac.com/" target="_blank">PodTrac</a> for free analytics.</p><p>You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/randylubin/jamming-on-games" target="_blank">repo on GitHub</a> and I’m happy to answer any questions!</p>
