<p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that I&rsquo;m joining <a href="http://meetings.io/" target="_blank">Meetings.io</a> as the COO.</p>
<p>While consulting has been fun, I&rsquo;ve kept an eye out for an amazing team with an incredible vision. I&rsquo;ve found it in Meetings.io. The cofounders, Denis Mars and Arend Naylor are brilliant and awesome. I helped build the core product last fall, as a consultant, and had a great time working with them.</p>
<p>Meetings.io enables effortless video chat in the browser. No downloads, no logins necessary; just one click and you&rsquo;re in a video room with a unique URL.  If you choose to login, you can have a persistant room with a custom URL.</p>
<p>The current product is very cool but the long term vision is incredible and I hope to share it in the coming months.</p>
<p>While my title will be COO, a better description is <em>the business guy</em>. I&rsquo;ll have my hands in everything and will collaborate with the cofounders on strategy, product, hiring, fundraising, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be starting this week and it&rsquo;s going to be an amazing journey.</p>
