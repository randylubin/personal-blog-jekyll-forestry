<p>Earlier today I toured the <a href="http://www.sfmead.com/" target="_blank">San Francisco Mead Company</a>. It’s been around for a few years and is located in Bayview. Mead is made from fermented honey, sometimes mixed with juice.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfbf72a40f18da3e93660ca92887013a/tumblr_inline_nv0crgQwFI1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>We started out by trying some of the mead. My favorite was the California Gold, though all the varieties were tasty. They had a coffee Mead (cold brewed with Ritual coffee that was very interesting.</p><p>Next we toured the facility - SF Mead Company is run out of a small warehouse. We tasted some raw honey and it was delicious.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/36ecab18e67883bfa8ebffdbd218e102/tumblr_inline_nv0cwjYa6g1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>We then saw the vats where the new batch was fermenting and tried some very young mead that had only been in there for a few days - it tasted like apple juice.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e25ca6af65245733103df4d30aad804/tumblr_inline_nv0cxxthFS1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>We also tasted some of the mead aging in in steel drums. The mead usually ages one to three years. There was a delicious blackberry mead that was a few years old.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8fcb8d9613d8a05c139a1ae3f6c72c5/tumblr_inline_nv0czols1R1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure><p>Overall it was a fun tour and I learned a bit more about mead. They’re open to the public every Saturday afternoon if you want to check it out.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/53cfa225f82b5841a68165a9b2d2bca1/tumblr_inline_nv0d1sXhqz1qc3e3u_540.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure>
