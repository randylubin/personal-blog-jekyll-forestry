<p>Last <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/post/30779279027/23andme-results-im-3-2-neanderthal" target="_blank">post</a> I shared the health findings of my 23andMe genome sequencing, in the post I&rsquo;ll talk about the Ancestry results.</p>
<p>I had to wait a week extra for the Ancestry portion of the results and I&rsquo;m a bit underwhelmed. Here&rsquo;s the breakdown of major info:</p>
<p><strong>Maternal and Paternal Haplogroups</strong>: H and J2, respectively. These indicate which regions my ancestors were likely from and in which migration wave they took part. The maternal group: H is a broad indicator of early migration to Europe&hellip; it&rsquo;s prevalent in many Europeans. The paternal group, J2 is highly prevalent in the Middle East and southern Europe. no surprise in either of these findings.</p>
<p><strong>Relative Finder</strong>: this shows other 23andMe users likely to be related&hellip; they found a bunch of people with ~1.2% DNA; maybe 2nd-4th cousins (not that exciting).</p>
<p><strong>Country Similarity:</strong> This is a breakdown of what countries my ancestors were likely from (based on similarity with other 23andMe participants). The top results were Russia 10%, Ukraine 7%, Poland 6%. This isn&rsquo;t shocking as I know my great great grandparents were from the Pale of Settlement - the Jewish region in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Overall, not too much new information. I was generally unimpressed by the part of 23andMe results but I&rsquo;m sure I would have been fascinated if it turned out a chunk of my genome was from Africa, India, or Japan!</p>
<p>This concludes my series of posts on 23andMe&hellip; overall I&rsquo;m glad I did it but am not overwhelmingly thrilled by service. It&rsquo;s a bit of a relief knowing that there aren&rsquo;t any ticking time bombs in my genome. My information will keep updating as 23andMe continues to learn more about what genes map to which phenotypes&hellip; hopefully there will be some other interesting results in the future. </p>
