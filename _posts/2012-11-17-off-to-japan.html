<p>It&rsquo;s Thanksgiving in a few days so naturally I&rsquo;m off to Japan!</p>



<p>My roommate Adam scored some cheap tickets so we&rsquo;re setting off tomorrow for a week-long trip.</p>



<p>Our schedule is almost totally inchoate but we&rsquo;re flying into Tokyo and out of Osaka. Along the way we might drop by:</p>



<ul><li>Kyoto</li>
<li>Nara</li>
<li>Hiroshima</li>
</ul><p>We probably won&rsquo;t hit all of them but we have an unlimited rail pass so we have tons of flexibility.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re also hoping to stay a night in some small fishing village, just to try something different; if you have any suggestions, let me know!</p>



<p>Earlier, I sent a blast on Twitter / Facebook to find some amazing people to meet up with; it looks like we&rsquo;ll be hanging out with the Japanese start-up crowd in Tokyo; should be great! Also makes me appreciate the power of social media to facilitate last minute awesomeness.</p>



<p>Internet should be plentiful so hopefully I&rsquo;ll be posting during the trip. If not, look forward to a big update post when I get back! </p>
