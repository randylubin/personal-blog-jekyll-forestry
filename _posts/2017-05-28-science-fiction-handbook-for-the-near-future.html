<p>Part my process for exploring startup ideas is building models of the near future and extrapolating technology trends. In doing so, I borrow ideas from startups, scientists, think tanks, and *especially* science fiction.<br/></p><p>As a way to capture my explorations and to share it them more broadly, I’m thinking about creating a Science Fiction Handbook for the Near Future. This guide would look at different technological and social trends and project their potential trajectories over the next handful of years. It would then cite different science fiction movies, books, and games that play with those trends and highlight some of the best design fiction in those topics.</p><p>I’m thinking about creating it as a wiki so the topics can interlink and other folks can contribute. If you’re interested in helping or have ideas about format and contents - let me know!</p>
